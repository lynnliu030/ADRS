The main areas for improvement are identified as efficiency of core algorithms and potential simplification/readability.\n\nThe key bottleneck for `speed_score` is likely the heavy reliance on CPU operations and Python loops within functions that could leverage PyTorch's GPU acceleration and vectorized operations.\n\nMy proposed improvements focus on two main areas:\n1.  **Eliminate unnecessary CPU transfers:** The `rebalance_experts` function explicitly moves the `weight` tensor to CPU at the beginning, forcing all subsequent heavy computations (`balanced_packing`, `replicate_experts`) to run on CPU. By keeping these computations on the original device (typically GPU), we can achieve significant speedups.\n2.  **Vectorize `balanced_packing`:** The `balanced_packing` function uses Python lists and a `min` operation within nested loops. This can be replaced with PyTorch tensor operations (`torch.argmin`, `torch.where`) to perform selections and updates much more efficiently, especially for larger tensor sizes. While the asymptotic complexity remains similar (O(num\\_layers \\* num\\_groups \\* num\\_packs)), the constant factor for PyTorch tensor operations on GPU is vastly superior to Python list operations on CPU.\n\nThese changes are expected to primarily boost `speed_score` and, consequently, `combined_score`, while preserving the `balancedness_score` as the underlying greedy algorithms for load balancing remain unchanged.\n\nHere are the specific changes:\n\n### Improvement 1: Keep computations on GPU by removing `.cpu()` calls and ensuring device consistency.\n\n**Reasoning:** The `rebalance_experts` function explicitly calls `.cpu()` on the input `weight` tensor. This forces all subsequent tensor operations within `rebalance_experts_hierarchical` (and its sub-functions like `balanced_packing` and `replicate_experts`) to execute on the CPU. PyTorch operations are significantly faster on GPUs. By removing the `.cpu()` call and ensuring all newly created tensors (e.g., `pack_index`, `rank_in_pack`, `log2phy`) are on the correct device (inherited from `weight` or explicitly set to `weight.device`), we can leverage GPU acceleration.\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    weight = weight.float().cpu()\n    if num_groups % num_nodes == 0:\n        # use hierarchical load-balance policy\n        phy2log, phyrank, logcnt = rebalance_experts_hierarchical(\n            weight, num_replicas, num_groups, num_nodes, num_gpus)\n    else:\n        # use global load-balance policy\n        phy2log, phyrank, logcnt = rebalance_experts_hierarchical(\n            weight, num_replicas, 1, 1, num_gpus)\n    num_redundant_experts = num_replicas - num_logical_experts\n    maxlogcnt = num_redundant_experts + 1\n    log2phy: torch.Tensor = torch.full(\n        (num_layers, num_logical_experts, maxlogcnt),\n        -1,\n        dtype=torch.int64,\n        device=logcnt.device,\n    )\n    log2phy.view(num_layers, -1).scatter_(\n        -1,\n        phy2log * maxlogcnt + phyrank,\n        torch.arange(num_replicas, dtype=torch.int64,\n                     device=log2phy.device).expand(num_layers, -1),\n    )\n=======\n    # Ensure weight is float, keep on original device (likely GPU)\n    weight = weight.float()\n    # Determine the device for all subsequent tensor operations\n    device = weight.device\n\n    if num_groups % num_nodes == 0:\n        # use hierarchical load-balance policy\n        phy2log, phyrank, logcnt = rebalance_experts_hierarchical(\n            weight, num_replicas, num_groups, num_nodes, num_gpus)\n    else:\n        # use global load-balance policy\n        phy2log, phyrank, logcnt = rebalance_experts_hierarchical(\n            weight, num_replicas, 1, 1, num_gpus)\n    num_redundant_experts = num_replicas - num_logical_experts\n    maxlogcnt = num_redundant_experts + 1\n    log2phy: torch.Tensor = torch.full(\n        (num_layers, num_logical_experts, maxlogcnt),\n        -1,\n        dtype=torch.int64,\n        device=device, # Use 'device' variable here\n    )\n    log2phy.view(num_layers, -1).scatter_(\n        -1,\n        phy2log * maxlogcnt + phyrank,\n        torch.arange(num_replicas, dtype=torch.int64,\n                     device=device).expand(num_layers, -1), # Use 'device' variable here\n    )\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\n### Improvement 2: Vectorize `balanced_packing` using PyTorch operations.\n\n**Reasoning:** The original `balanced_packing` function uses Python lists (`pack_weights`, `pack_items`) and the `min()` function with a custom key inside a loop. This leads to Python overhead and prevents efficient parallelization. By converting `pack_weights` and `pack_items` to PyTorch tensors and using `torch.argmin` in conjunction with `torch.where` to find the minimum-weight eligible pack, we can leverage PyTorch's optimized tensor operations, significantly speeding up this core loop. The sorting `indices` is also kept on the device.\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        indices = weight.float().sort(-1, descending=True).indices.cpu()\n        pack_index = torch.full_like(weight,\n                                     fill_value=-1,\n                                     dtype=torch.int64,\n                                     device=\"cpu\")\n        rank_in_pack = torch.full_like(pack_index, fill_value=-1)\n        for i in range(num_layers):\n            pack_weights = [0] * num_packs\n            pack_items = [0] * num_packs\n            for group in indices[i]:\n                pack = min(\n                    (i\n                     for i in range(num_packs) if pack_items[i] < groups_per_pack),\n                    key=pack_weights.__getitem__,\n                )\n                assert pack_items[pack] < groups_per_pack\n                pack_index[i, group] = pack\n                rank_in_pack[i, group] = pack_items[pack]\n                pack_weights[pack] += weight[i, group]\n                pack_items[pack] += 1\n=======\n        indices = weight.float().sort(-1, descending=True).indices\n        pack_index = torch.full_like(weight,\n                                     fill_value=-1,\n                                     dtype=torch.int64)\n        rank_in_pack = torch.full_like(pack_index, fill_value=-1)\n        for i in range(num_layers):\n            # Use tensors for pack_weights and pack_items, initialized per layer\n            pack_weights_i = torch.zeros(num_packs, dtype=weight.dtype, device=weight.device)\n            pack_items_i = torch.zeros(num_packs, dtype=torch.int64, device=weight.device)\n            for group_idx_in_sorted_order in range(num_groups):\n                group = indices[i, group_idx_in_sorted_order]\n                \n                # Find eligible packs (those with < groups_per_pack items)\n                eligible_mask = (pack_items_i < groups_per_pack)\n                # Set weights of ineligible packs to infinity to prevent selection\n                eligible_weights = torch.where(eligible_mask, pack_weights_i, torch.full_like(pack_weights_i, float('inf')))\n                # Find the index of the minimum weight among eligible packs\n                pack = torch.argmin(eligible_weights)\n\n                # Assign the current group to the selected pack\n                pack_index[i, group] = pack\n                rank_in_pack[i, group] = pack_items_i[pack]\n                \n                # Update pack weights and item counts\n                pack_weights_i[pack] += weight[i, group]\n                pack_items_i[pack] += 1\n>>>>>>> REPLACE"]}}}
