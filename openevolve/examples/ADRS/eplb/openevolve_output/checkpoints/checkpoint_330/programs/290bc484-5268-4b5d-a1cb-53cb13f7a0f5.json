This is peculiar, as the provided \"Current Program\" code is identical to the \"Top Performing Programs\". This suggests the regression might be due to changes in the evaluation environment, input data, or a subtle external factor rather than a direct code bug.\n\nHowever, as per the instructions, I must suggest improvements to the program code itself. The core algorithms (`balanced_packing`, `replicate_experts`) are greedy heuristics for NP-hard problems, which are generally good for balancedness given the complexity constraint. The primary area for improvement in terms of *speed* for such algorithms, especially when implemented with Python loops, is to reduce Python overhead or avoid unnecessary operations.\n\nUpon review, the code is generally well-structured and uses PyTorch operations efficiently within the loops. All tensor operations correctly respect the device of the input `weight` tensor. The main bottleneck remains the Python loops iterating over `num_layers` and `num_groups` (in `balanced_packing`) and `num_redundant` experts (in `replicate_experts`), as these inherently sequential greedy algorithms are difficult to fully vectorize across these dimensions in PyTorch without a fundamental algorithmic change.\n\nGiven these constraints, the most impactful and safe change that can directly affect execution time is to remove non-essential runtime checks, such as `assert` statements, which are typically removed in performance-critical production code. The `assert` in `balanced_packing` verifies a condition that should always hold true if the preceding logic (`torch.where` setting full packs to infinity) is correct. Removing it will slightly reduce overhead in each inner loop iteration.\n\n**Proposed Change:**\n\nRemove the `assert` statement in the `balanced_packing` function. This assert, while useful for debugging, adds a small overhead in each iteration of the inner loop. Since the logic of marking full packs with `float('inf')` and then using `argmin` should guarantee that an available pack is always chosen (unless all packs are somehow full, which would contradict the problem setup `groups_per_pack > 0`), this assertion should theoretically never fail. Removing it is a common micro-optimization for performance-sensitive code.\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n            # Assert that a valid pack was found and it has space.\n            # This check remains important to ensure algorithm correctness.\n            assert current_pack_items[pack] < groups_per_pack\n=======\n            # The logic ensures a valid pack with space is always found.\n            # Removing this assert for minor performance gain in production.\n>>>>>>> REPLACE"]}}}
