The core of this policy relies on the `balanced_packing` function, which distributes weighted items into a fixed number of packs, ensuring each pack contains an equal number of items while balancing the total weight. The `replicate_experts` function handles the creation of redundant experts to further balance the load.\n\n**Analysis of Current Implementation and Identified Areas for Improvement:**\n\n1.  **Speed (Efficiency):**\n    *   The `rebalance_experts` function first moves the `weight` tensor to CPU (`weight.float().cpu()`). This is likely done because the `balanced_packing` function contains Python `for` loops and list manipulations (`pack_weights = [0] * num_packs`, `pack_items = [0] * num_packs`, and the `min` operation on these lists). Performing these operations directly on GPU tensors with Python loops would incur significant host-device synchronization overhead, making CPU execution potentially faster for these specific parts.\n    *   However, within the `balanced_packing` function, the `for group in indices[i]:` loop iterates through each group for every layer in Python. Inside this loop, the `min` operation on Python lists (`pack_weights`) is performed. While efficient for very small `num_packs`, it's not as performant as vectorized tensor operations, especially if `num_packs` (which can be `num_nodes` or `num_gpus // num_nodes`) becomes moderately large (e.g., > 32).\n\n2.  **Balancedness:**\n    *   Both `balanced_packing` and `replicate_experts` employ greedy heuristics. `balanced_packing` uses a variant of the Longest Processing Time (LPT) heuristic by sorting items by weight in descending order and assigning them to the pack with the minimum current total weight. `replicate_experts` assigns new replicas to the logical expert with the highest average load. These are standard and generally effective greedy heuristics for NP-hard problems, but they are not guaranteed to be optimal, which could explain the `balancedness_score` of `0.2983`.\n\n3.  **Readability/Maintainability:**\n    *   The use of Python lists (`pack_weights`, `pack_items`) within a PyTorch-centric codebase can feel less idiomatic and potentially harder to reason about for developers accustomed to tensor operations.\n\n**Proposed Improvement:**\n\nThe primary improvement will focus on enhancing the `balanced_packing` function. We will replace the Python list manipulations and the `min()` function with equivalent PyTorch tensor operations. This change aims to:\n\n1.  **Improve Speed:** By using vectorized PyTorch operations (`torch.zeros`, `torch.where`, `torch.argmin`) instead of Python lists and `min()`, the inner loop operations will be executed in C/CUDA, leading to faster execution, especially as `num_packs` increases. While the outer `for i in range(num_layers)` loop will remain in Python (as the greedy assignment for each layer is sequential), the per-group operations will be significantly optimized.\n2.  **Improve Readability and Maintainability:** The code will become more consistent with PyTorch's tensor-based approach, making it easier to understand and maintain.\n3.  **Potential for Balancedness Improvement (Minor):** While the underlying greedy algorithm remains the same, using `torch.argmin` might have slightly different tie-breaking behavior compared to Python's `min`, which could lead to minor differences in load distribution. However, the primary goal here is speed and code quality.\n\n**Detailed Changes:**\n\nIn the `balanced_packing` function:\n*   Instead of initializing `pack_weights` and `pack_items` as Python lists inside the `num_layers` loop, we will declare `pack_weights_per_layer` and `pack_items_per_layer` as PyTorch tensors of shape `[num_layers, num_packs]` once. This allows for more efficient memory allocation and access.\n*   Inside the inner loop (`for group_idx in indices[i]`), the logic to find the best pack will be rewritten using `torch.where` to mask unavailable packs (those already full) and `torch.argmin` to efficiently find the pack with the minimum current weight.\n\nThis change optimizes the core bottleneck within `balanced_packing` without changing the fundamental greedy logic, thus providing a good balance between performance and algorithmic complexity.\n\n```diff\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    for i in range(num_layers):\n        pack_weights = [0] * num_packs\n        pack_items = [0] * num_packs\n        for group in indices[i]:\n            pack = min(\n                (i\n                 for i in range(num_packs) if pack_items[i] < groups_per_pack),\n                key=pack_weights.__getitem__,\n            )\n            assert pack_items[pack] < groups_per_pack\n            pack_index[i, group] = pack\n            rank_in_pack[i, group] = pack_items[pack]\n            pack_weights[pack] += weight[i, group]\n            pack_items[pack] += 1\n=======\n    # Initialize tensors to hold pack weights and item counts for all layers.\n    # These are on CPU because the input 'weight' is moved to CPU in rebalance_experts.\n    pack_weights_per_layer = torch.zeros(\n        num_layers, num_packs, dtype=weight.dtype, device=weight.device)\n    pack_items_per_layer = torch.zeros(\n        num_layers, num_packs, dtype=torch.int64, device=weight.device)\n\n    # Iterate over each layer.
