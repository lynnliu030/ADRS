Each SEARCH section must exactly match code in the current program.\nBe thoughtful about your changes and explain your reasoning thoroughly.\n\nIMPORTANT: Do not rewrite the entire program - focus on targeted improvements.\n", "responses": ["The current performance metrics show a regression, particularly in `speed_score` and `balancedness_score`. The goal is to improve both.\n\nThe core of the expert rearrangement algorithm lies in `rebalance_experts_hierarchical` and its helper functions: `balanced_packing` and `replicate_experts`.\n\n**Analysis of Current Program and Bottlenecks:**\n\n1.  **`balanced_packing` function (Speed Improvement):**\n    *   This function is called multiple times within `rebalance_experts_hierarchical`.\n    *   The inner loop `for group in indices[i]:` currently uses Python lists (`pack_weights`, `pack_items`) and a Python `min()` function with a generator expression and `__getitem__`. This pattern is known to be inefficient for large inputs due to Python's interpreter overhead and lack of vectorization.\n    *   Converting `pack_weights` and `pack_items` to PyTorch tensors and using vectorized tensor operations (`torch.argmin`, `torch.where`) can significantly speed up this critical section. The logic of selecting the pack with the minimum current weight (while respecting capacity) remains the same, ensuring `balancedness_score` is not negatively impacted.\n\n2.  **`replicate_experts` function (Minor Speed/Clarity):**\n    *   The loop `for i in range(num_log, num_phy):` is inherently sequential due to the greedy nature of the replication. Full vectorization is difficult without changing the algorithm.\n    *   The `(weight / logcnt).max(dim=-1).indices` operation is already vectorized.\n    *   Minor redundancy: `arangen` is created inside the loop, but it's small.\n\n3.  **`rebalance_experts` and `rebalance_experts_hierarchical` (Balancedness & Overall):**\n    *   The algorithm implemented (DeepSeek EPLB's hierarchical approach) is a known heuristic for this NP-hard problem. If the `balancedness_score` has regressed while the core algorithm logic seems to be preserved from top-performing versions, it might indicate:\n        *   Subtle numerical stability issues (though `float32` is generally sufficient).\n        *   Changes in input data characteristics that expose weaknesses in the heuristic.\n        *   A bug introduced in a previous, unmentioned change.\n    *   Without more context on the \"unknown changes\" that led to regression, making fundamental changes to the balancing heuristic is risky. The most robust approach is to ensure the existing heuristic is implemented as efficiently and correctly as possible.\n    *   The initial `weight = weight.float().cpu()` in `rebalance_experts` ensures all subsequent operations are performed on the CPU. The `balanced_packing` function's `indices = weight.float().sort(-1, descending=True).indices.cpu()` contains a redundant `.cpu()` call if `weight` is already on CPU. Removing this is a minor optimization.\n\n**Proposed Changes:**\n\nThe primary improvement will be to optimize the `balanced_packing` function by replacing Python list operations with PyTorch tensor operations. This directly addresses the `speed_score` regression and ensures the greedy load balancing logic is executed more efficiently without altering its outcome, thus not degrading `balancedness_score`.\n\n**Detailed Changes:**\n\n1.  **`balanced_packing`:** Replace the Python list-based iteration for selecting the next pack with tensor operations.\n    *   Initialize `pack_weights` and `pack_items` as `torch.Tensor`s.\n    *   Use `torch.where` to conditionally set weights of full packs to infinity.\n    *   Use `torch.argmin` to efficiently find the pack with the minimum load.\n    *   Remove redundant `.cpu()` call in `indices` calculation.\n\nThis change is expected to significantly improve the `speed_score` and maintain or potentially slightly improve `balancedness_score` due to more stable/faster execution.\n\n```python\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    indices = weight.float().sort(-1, descending=True).indices.cpu()\n    pack_index = torch.full_like(weight,\n                                 fill_value=-1,\n                                 dtype=torch.int64,\n                                 device=\"cpu\")\n    rank_in_pack = torch.full_like(pack_index, fill_value=-1)\n    for i in range(num_layers):\n        pack_weights = [0] * num_packs\n        pack_items = [0] * num_packs\n        for group in indices[i]:\n            pack = min(\n                (i\n                 for i in range(num_packs) if pack_items[i] < groups_per_pack),\n                key=pack_weights.__getitem__,\n            )\n            assert pack_items[pack] < groups_per_pack\n            pack_index[i, group] = pack\n            rank_in_pack[i, group] = pack_items[pack]\n            pack_weights[pack] += weight[i, group]\n            pack_items[pack] += 1\n=======\n    # Ensure indices are on the correct device (CPU, as weight is already on CPU)\n    indices = weight.float().sort(-1, descending=True).indices\n    \n    # Initialize pack_index and rank_in_pack on CPU\n    pack_index = torch.full_like(weight,\n                                 fill_value=-1,\n                                 dtype=torch.int64,\n                                 device=\"cpu\")\n    rank_in_pack = torch.full_like(pack_index, fill_value=-1)\n    \n    for i in range(num_layers):\n        # Use tensors for pack_weights and pack_items for better performance\n        # These tensors are re-initialized for each layer, as packing is done per layer.\n        pack_weights_t = torch.zeros(num_packs, dtype=torch.float32, device=\"cpu\")\n        pack_items_t = torch.zeros(num_packs, dtype=torch.int64, device=\"cpu\")\n        \n        for group_idx in indices[i]:\n            # Create a mask for packs that still have capacity\n            available_packs_mask = (pack_items_t < groups_per_pack)\n            \n            # Temporarily set weights of full packs to infinity to exclude them from argmin.\n            # torch.where is efficient for conditional assignment.\n            temp_pack_weights = torch.where(available_packs_mask, pack_weights_t, torch.tensor(float('inf'), dtype=torch.float32, device=\"cpu\"))\n            \n            # Find the pack with the minimum weight among available ones.\n            # torch.argmin handles finding the index of the minimum value.\n            pack = torch.argmin(temp_pack_weights)\n            \n            # Update pack_index and rank_in_pack for the current group\n            pack_index[i, group_idx] = pack\n            rank_in_pack[i, group_idx] = pack_items_t[pack]\n            \n            # Update pack_weights and pack_items for the selected pack\n            pack_weights_t[pack] += weight[i, group_idx]\n            pack_items_t[pack] += 1\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```"]}}}
