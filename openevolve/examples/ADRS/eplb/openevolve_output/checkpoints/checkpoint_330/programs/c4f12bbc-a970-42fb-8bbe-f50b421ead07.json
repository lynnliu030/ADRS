This can be a significant bottleneck if the `weight` tensor originates on a GPU, as it forces all subsequent computations in `balanced_packing` and `replicate_experts` to occur on the CPU or involve further transfers. By keeping tensors on their original device (likely GPU in a vLLM context) as much as possible, we can leverage GPU acceleration for PyTorch operations, significantly improving `speed_score`.\n\n2.  **Balancedness Improvement (Robust Hierarchical Balancing):** The `rebalance_experts` function currently falls back to a global balancing policy (by setting `num_groups=1` and `num_nodes=1`) if `num_groups` is not perfectly divisible by `num_nodes`. This fallback might be suboptimal for load balancing, as it loses the benefits of hierarchical grouping and node locality. By modifying the `balanced_packing` function to gracefully handle non-divisible item-to-pack assignments (i.e., allowing some packs to hold `floor(N/M)+1` items and others `floor(N/M)`), we can apply the hierarchical policy more universally, potentially leading to a better `balancedness_score`.\n\n### Proposed Changes\n\nThe following changes address these two areas:\n\n**Change 1: Device Consistency for Speed**\n\n*   **`rebalance_experts` function:** Remove the explicit `.cpu()` call, allowing the `weight` tensor to remain on its original device (e.g., GPU).\n*   **`balanced_packing` function:** Ensure all temporary tensors and intermediate results (`indices`, `pack_index`, `rank_in_pack`) are created and processed on the same device as the input `weight` tensor.\n\n**Change 2: Robust Hierarchical Balancing for Balancedness**\n\n*   **`balanced_packing` function:**\n    *   Remove the strict `assert num_groups % num_packs == 0`.\n    *   Implement logic to dynamically calculate the maximum number of items per pack, allowing for an uneven but balanced distribution when `num_groups` is not perfectly divisible by `num_packs`.\n    *   Update the capacity check (`available_mask`) to use these dynamic per-pack limits.\n    *   Refine the special case handling for `num_groups <= num_packs` to be more general and efficient.\n*   **`rebalance_experts` function:** Remove the `else` block that forces a global balancing policy, as `rebalance_experts_hierarchical` (with the improved `balanced_packing`) will now be able to handle all cases directly.\n\nThese changes aim to improve the algorithm's efficiency by minimizing data transfers and maximizing GPU utilization, while also enhancing its load balancing capabilities by making the hierarchical strategy more broadly applicable.\n\n```diff\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    weight = weight.float().cpu()\n    if num_groups % num_nodes == 0:\n        # use hierarchical load-balance policy\n        phy2log, phyrank, logcnt = rebalance_experts_hierarchical(\n            weight, num_replicas, num_groups, num_nodes, num_gpus)\n    else:\n        # use global load-balance policy\n        phy2log, phyrank, logcnt = rebalance_experts_hierarchical(\n            weight, num_replicas, 1, 1, num_gpus)\n    num_redundant_experts = num_replicas -
