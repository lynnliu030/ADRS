The goal is to improve both.\n\nUpon reviewing the code, a critical change in the `replicate_experts` function has been identified as a likely cause for the `balancedness_score` regression. The comment explicitly states: `# The original code used .max(dim=-1).indices, which seems incorrect for load balancing. # We replace it with .argmin() to select the least loaded expert.`\n\nHowever, for load balancing, especially when the goal is to \"minimize the maximum load\", it is generally more effective to add a replica to the expert that currently has the *highest* average load. If `weight / logcnt` represents the average load per replica, then `max(dim=-1).indices` would select the expert with the highest average load, which is precisely where adding a new replica would yield the most significant reduction in overall system load imbalance. The change to `argmin` would instead add replicas to the *least* loaded experts, which would worsen load balancing. Reverting this change is crucial for restoring the `balancedness_score`.\n\nFor `speed_score`, while the overall greedy approach is inherently sequential to some extent, minor optimizations can be made. In the `balanced_packing` function, the `torch.where` call inside the main loop uses `torch.full_like(current_pack_weights, float('inf'))`. `torch.where` supports scalar broadcasting, so creating a full tensor of infinities repeatedly is unnecessary and can be optimized by directly passing `float('inf')`. This is a micro-optimization that reduces tensor creation overhead in a frequently executed loop.\n\n**Proposed Changes:**\n\n1.  **Revert `argmin` to `max(dim=-1).indices` in `replicate_experts`:** This directly addresses the `balancedness_score` regression by restoring the correct load balancing strategy. By adding replicas to the most loaded experts, the algorithm aims to minimize the maximum load across all experts.\n\n2.  **Simplify `torch.where` in `balanced_packing`:** Replace `torch.full_like(current_pack_weights, float('inf'))` with `float('inf')` directly. This is a minor efficiency improvement that reduces memory allocation and computation overhead in a hot loop.\n\nThese two changes are targeted, address identified issues, and are consistent with the structure of the previous top-performing programs.\n\n---\n### Diff 1: Revert `replicate_experts` from `argmin` to `max`\n\nThis change corrects the load balancing logic, ensuring that new replicas are assigned to the most heavily loaded experts to reduce their average load and thus balance the system more effectively.\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        redundant_indices = (weight / logcnt).argmin(dim=-1)\n=======\n        redundant_indices = (weight / logcnt).max(dim=-1).indices\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\n---\n### Diff 2: Simplify `torch.where` in `balanced_packing`\n\nThis is a micro-optimization to improve the efficiency of the `balanced_packing` function by avoiding the repeated creation of a full tensor of infinity values. `torch.where` can broadcast a scalar value directly.\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n            candidate_weights = torch.where(available_mask, current_pack_weights,\n                                            torch.full_like(current_pack_weights, float('inf')))\n=======\n            candidate_weights = torch.where(available_mask, current_pack_weights, float('inf'))\n>>>>>>> REPLACE"]}}}
