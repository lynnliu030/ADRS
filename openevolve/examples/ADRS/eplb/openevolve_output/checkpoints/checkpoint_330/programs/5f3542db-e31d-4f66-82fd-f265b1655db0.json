Analyzing the `balanced_packing` function reveals an inefficiency in how available packs are managed. The original code repeatedly recomputes `available_pack_indices` and performs `torch.argmin` on a subset of pack weights within a loop. This leads to a complexity of `O(num_groups * num_packs)` per layer.\n\nThe proposed improvement for `balanced_packing` is to replace this inefficient selection process with a min-heap (priority queue). By maintaining a min-heap of `(current_pack_weight, pack_id)` for each layer, we can efficiently retrieve the pack with the minimum current load in `O(log(num_packs))` time. When an item is assigned to a pack, its weight is updated, and if the pack is not yet full, it's pushed back into the heap. This reduces the complexity per layer to `O(num_groups * log(num_packs))`, which is a significant speedup, especially when `num_packs` is large. This change also simplifies the code and improves readability.\n\nAdditionally, a minor cleanup in `replicate_experts` involves removing an unused variable. The `replicate_experts` function already utilizes a heap-based approach efficiently for its task, so no major algorithmic changes are needed there.\n\nThese changes are expected to significantly improve the `speed_score` without negatively impacting the `balancedness_score`, as the core greedy strategy for load balancing (assigning the largest item to the least loaded bin) remains the same.\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        # Create a mask for packs that are not yet full.\n        not_full_mask = current_pack_items < groups_per_pack\n        \n        # Find the indices of available packs.\n        available_pack_indices = torch.where(not_full_mask)[0]\n        \n        # If all packs are full, this should not happen given the problem constraints.\n        # Asserting this for debugging.\n        assert torch.any(not_full_mask), \"All packs are full, but we are still assigning items.\"\n\n        # Iterate through the group IDs sorted by weight.\n        for group_idx_in_sorted_list in range(num_groups):\n            # Get the actual group ID from the sorted indices.\n            group_id = layer_indices[group_idx_in_sorted_list].item()\n\n            # Get the weights corresponding to these available pack indices.\n            weights_of_available_packs = current_pack_weights[available_pack_indices]\n            \n            # Find the index within the `available_pack_indices` tensor that corresponds to the minimum weight.\n            best_available_idx = torch.argmin(weights_of_available_packs)\n            \n            # Get the actual pack index (the original index in the `num_packs` dimension).\n            pack = available_pack_indices[best_available_idx]\n\n            # Assign the group to the chosen pack.\n            # The `group_id` is the column index for the `pack_index` and `rank_in_pack` tensors.\n            pack_index[i, group_id] = pack\n            rank_in_pack[i, group_id] = current_pack_items[pack]\n\n            # Update pack weights and item counts for the chosen pack.\n            current_pack_weights[pack] += weight[i, group_id]\n            current_pack_items[pack] += 1\n\n            # After assigning an item to a pack, we need to update the `not_full_mask` and `available_pack_indices`\n            # for the next iteration.
