Each SEARCH section must exactly match code in the current program.\nBe thoughtful about your changes and explain your reasoning thoroughly.\n\nIMPORTANT: Do not rewrite the entire program - focus on targeted improvements.\n", "responses": ["The current program achieves a `balancedness_score` of 0.2983, but the `speed_score` and `combined_score` have regressed to 0.0247 and 0.1615 respectively. This indicates that while the balancing is decent, the algorithm is too slow. The goal is to improve both aspects.\n\nLooking at the history, Attempts 1, 2, and 3 all showed improvements in all metrics, with the `speed_score` being around 0.0835-0.0857 and `combined_score` around 0.1909-0.1920. The current implementation seems to have lost these improvements. The primary focus should be on speeding up the `rebalance_experts` and its helper functions, `balanced_packing` and `replicate_experts`, without significantly degrading the `balancedness_score`.\n\nLet's analyze the `rebalance_experts_hierarchical` function and its helpers.\n\n**Observations and Potential Improvements:**\n\n1.  **`balanced_packing`:**\n    *   The inner loop iterates through `indices[i]` (groups sorted by weight). For each group, it finds the minimum weight available pack.\n    *   The line `available_pack_indices = torch.nonzero(available_mask).squeeze(-1)` and then `weights_of_available_packs = current_pack_weights[available_pack_indices]` can be inefficient. Instead of creating a mask, finding non-zero indices, and then indexing again, we can directly find the minimum among available packs.\n    *   The current implementation uses `torch.argmin` on a subset of weights, which is good, but the intermediate steps might be optimized.\n    *   The assertion `assert available_pack_indices.numel() > 0` is good for correctness but might add a small overhead if it's hit frequently in a non-error state. However, it's crucial for debugging.\n\n2.  **`replicate_experts`:**\n    *   The loop `for i in range(num_log, num_phy):` iterates to create redundant experts.\n    *   Inside the loop, `(weight / logcnt).max(dim=-1).indices` is a core operation. This calculation is repeated for each new physical expert.\n    *   The repeated calculation of `weight / logcnt` and then `max(dim=-1).indices` might be a bottleneck.\n\n3.  **`rebalance_experts_hierarchical`:**\n    *   This function orchestrates the calls to `balanced_packing` and `replicate_experts`.\n    *   The `inverse` helper function uses `scatter_`, which is generally efficient.\n    *   The logic of packing groups to nodes, constructing redundant experts within nodes, and packing physical experts to GPUs seems sound but might involve many tensor operations that could be optimized for speed.\n\n**Proposed Changes:**\n\nThe primary goal is to regain the lost speed. The \"Top Performing Programs\" and \"Inspiration Programs\" history suggests that previous versions were significantly faster. The most likely culprit for the speed regression is inefficient tensor operations or Python-level loops that could be vectorized or optimized.\n\nLet's focus on optimizing `balanced_packing` and `replicate_experts` first, as these are the core computational kernels.\n\n**Optimization Strategy:**\n\n*   **`balanced_packing`:** Improve the selection of the minimum weight available pack.\n*   **`replicate_experts`:** Optimize the repeated calculation of `(weight / logcnt).max(dim=-1).indices`.\n\n---\n\n**Change 1: Optimize `balanced_packing` - More efficient selection of minimum weight pack.**\n\nInstead of finding `available_pack_indices` and then applying `argmin`, we can directly find the minimum among packs that have `current_pack_items < groups_per_pack`. This can be done by setting the weights of already full packs to infinity, then finding the overall minimum.\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n            # Find available packs (those not yet full).\n            # `available_mask` is a boolean tensor.\n            available_mask = (current_pack_items < groups_per_pack)\n\n            # Find the pack with the minimum current weight among available ones.\n            # This approach avoids creating a large temporary tensor with float('inf').\n            available_pack_indices = torch.nonzero(available_mask).squeeze(-1)\n            \n            # If no available packs, something is wrong with the logic or inputs.\n            # This assert ensures correctness under expected conditions.\n            assert available_pack_indices.numel() > 0, \"No available packs found, but expected to find one.\"\n\n            # Get weights of only the available packs\n            weights_of_available_packs = current_pack_weights[available_pack_indices]\n            \n            # Find the index within the `available_pack_indices` list that has the minimum weight.\n            local_min_idx = torch.argmin(weights_of_available_packs)\n            \n            # Map this local index back to the global pack index.\n            pack = available_pack_indices[local_min_idx] # pack is a 0-dim tensor\n\n            # Assert that a valid pack was found and it has space.\n            # `pack` is a 0-dim tensor, which can be used directly for indexing.\n            assert current_pack_items[pack] < groups_per_pack\n\n            # Assign the group to the chosen pack.\n            # `group_id` is a 0-dim tensor, which can be directly used for indexing.\n            pack_index[i, group_id] = pack\n            rank_in_pack[i, group_id] = current_pack_items[pack]\n\n            # Update pack weights and item counts for the chosen pack.\n            # `weight[i, group_id]` is the weight of the current group.\n            pack_weights_per_layer[i, pack] += weight[i, group_id]\n            pack_items_per_layer[i, pack] += 1\n    return pack_index, rank_in_pack\n=======\n            # Find the pack with the minimum current weight among available ones.\n            # Create a temporary tensor for available packs, setting full packs to infinity.\n            # This avoids explicit `nonzero` and indexing.\n            temp_weights = current_pack_weights.clone()\n            full_packs_mask = (current_pack_items >= groups_per_pack)\n            temp_weights[full_packs_mask] = float('inf')\n\n            # Find the index of the pack with the minimum weight.\n            # `pack` will be a 0-dim tensor.\n            pack = torch.argmin(temp_weights)\n\n            # Assert that a valid pack was found and it has space.\n            assert current_pack_items[pack] < groups_per_pack, \"No available packs found, or logic error.\"\n\n            # Assign the group to the chosen pack.\n            pack_index[i, group_id] = pack\n            rank_in_pack[i, group_id] = current_pack_items[pack]\n\n            # Update pack weights and item counts for the chosen pack.\n            pack_weights_per_layer[i, pack] += weight[i, group_id]\n            pack_items_per_layer[i, pack] += 1\n    return pack_index, rank_in_pack\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\n**Reasoning:** The original code first identified available packs using `torch.nonzero` and then found the minimum among them. This involves creating an intermediate tensor (`available_pack_indices`) and then indexing into `current_pack_weights`. The proposed change directly creates a temporary tensor `temp_weights`, masks out full packs with `float('inf')`, and then uses `torch.argmin` on the entire `temp_weights` tensor. This can be more efficient as it consolidates the search for the minimum into a single operation after a simple masking. It also simplifies the code and removes the need for `torch.nonzero` and subsequent indexing. The assertion is also simplified.\n\n---\n\n**Change 2: Optimize `replicate_experts` - Reduce redundant calculations.**\n\nThe loop `for i in range(num_log, num_phy):` recalculates `(weight / logcnt)` in each iteration. We can pre-calculate `weight / logcnt` and then use this pre-calculated value. Also, the `max(dim=-1).indices` operation can be a bottleneck.\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    for i in range(num_log, num_phy):\n        redundant_indices = (weight / logcnt).max(dim=-1).indices\n        phy2log[:, i] = redundant_indices\n        rank[:, i] = logcnt[arangen, redundant_indices]\n        logcnt[arangen, redundant_indices] += 1\n    return phy2log, rank, logcnt\n=======\n    # Pre-calculate the load-to-replica ratio for all logical experts.\n    # This avoids repeated division within the loop.\n    load_ratio = weight / logcnt\n\n    for i in range(num_log, num_phy):\n        # Find the logical expert that, when replicated, would have the minimum load.\n        # This is equivalent to finding the logical expert with the minimum (weight / logcnt).\n        redundant_indices = torch.argmin(load_ratio, dim=-1)\n        \n        # Assign the logical expert index to the current physical expert.\n        phy2log[:, i] = redundant_indices\n        \n        # Record the replica rank for this new physical expert.\n        # `logcnt[arangen, redundant_indices]` gives the current replica count for the chosen logical expert.\n        rank[:, i] = logcnt[arangen, redundant_indices]\n        \n        # Increment the replica count for the chosen logical expert.\n        logcnt[arangen, redundant_indices] += 1\n        \n        # Update the load_ratio for the chosen logical expert, as its replica count has increased.\n        # This ensures the next iteration considers the updated load distribution.\n        # We need to re-calculate the ratio for the expert that was just replicated.\n        # This is a critical step to ensure the greedy approach remains effective.\n        # We can update `load_ratio` in place for the selected indices.\n        # `redundant_indices` is a tensor of indices.\n        # `arangen` is a tensor of indices for the layers.\n        # `logcnt[arangen, redundant_indices]` is the *new* count.\n        load_ratio[arangen, redundant_indices] = weight[arangen, redundant_indices] / logcnt[arangen, redundant_indices]\n\n    return phy2log, rank, logcnt\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\n**Reasoning:**\nThe original code computed `(weight / logcnt)` inside the loop, which is inefficient if `num_phy` is significantly larger than `num_log`. By pre-calculating `load_ratio = weight / logcnt` once before the loop, we save repeated divisions.\n\nMore importantly, the original code used `.max(dim=-1).indices` which finds the index of the *maximum* value of `weight / logcnt`. This seems counter-intuitive for load balancing, where we'd want to pick the expert with the *minimum* load ratio to replicate to balance the load. The previous top-performing programs might have achieved good scores despite this potentially incorrect logic due to the specific test cases or other factors.\n\nThe corrected code uses `torch.argmin(load_ratio, dim=-1)` to find the logical expert with the *minimum* load ratio. This is the standard greedy approach for load balancing: add the next replica to the least loaded logical expert.\n\nFurthermore, after replicating an expert, its replica count (`logcnt`) increases. This means its *new* load ratio should be updated for subsequent decisions. The line `load_ratio[arangen, redundant_indices] = weight[arangen, redundant_indices] / logcnt[arangen, redundant_indices]` updates the `load_ratio` for the specific logical experts that were just replicated. This is crucial for the greedy algorithm to make informed decisions in subsequent iterations. Without this update, the algorithm would repeatedly pick the same initially least-loaded experts, failing to balance the load effectively as more replicas are added.\n\nThis change is a significant logical correction that should improve both `balancedness_score` and potentially `speed_score` by making the greedy choices more effective and avoiding redundant calculations.\n\n---\n\n**Change 3: Move `weight` to CPU early if not already there, and ensure operations are on CPU.**\n\nThe comment in `balanced_packing` mentions: \"'weight' is already float and on CPU from rebalance_experts, so no need for .float().cpu() here.\" However, the `rebalance_experts` function itself does `weight = weight.float()`. If the input `weight` is on GPU, `.float()` keeps it on GPU. If the previous top-performing programs were on CPU, this could explain the speed regression. Most of the heavy tensor operations in these functions (sorting, argmin, etc.) can be faster on CPU if the data size is not extremely large, and if the goal is to minimize latency for the rebalancing step itself, which is typically done infrequently.\n\nHowever, the prompt mentions that the input `weight` is \"load metrics recorded by the vLLM server\". vLLM typically operates on GPUs. Moving data between CPU and GPU incurs overhead. If the goal is to optimize the *entire* system, moving to CPU might not be the best idea if subsequent operations on the model also happen on GPU. But for the *rebalancing algorithm itself*, if it's a separate process or can tolerate a slight delay by offloading to CPU, it might be faster.\n\nLet's re-examine the comment: \"'weight' is already float and on CPU from rebalance_experts, so no need for .float().cpu() here.\" This implies `rebalance_experts` *might* be moving it to CPU. The current `rebalance_experts` does `weight = weight.float()`. This preserves the device.\n\nGiven the speed regression and the historical performance, it's worth ensuring that the operations within `balanced_packing` and `replicate_experts` are consistently performed on the same device. The primary operations like sorting and argmin can be efficient on GPU too. The key is avoiding unnecessary data transfers or inefficient operations.\n\nThe current code does not explicitly move data to CPU. Let's assume for now that the input `weight` is on GPU and the operations should remain on GPU if possible for overall system efficiency. The identified optimizations for `balanced_packing` and `replicate_experts` should improve performance regardless of the device, but the logical correction in `replicate_experts` is more critical.\n\nIf the speed issue is *solely* due to Python loops or inefficient tensor ops, the above changes should address it. If the speed issue is related to device placement, it's a more complex system-level optimization. For this task, focusing on algorithmic improvements is more appropriate.\n\nLet's stick to the algorithmic improvements. The logical correction in `replicate_experts` is the most impactful change for correctness and likely performance. The `balanced_packing` optimization is a good micro-optimization.\n\nFinal check on the `rebalance_experts_hierarchical` function logic:\n- `tokens_per_group = weight.unflatten(-1, (num_groups, group_size)).sum(-1)`: This sums weights for groups.\n- `balanced_packing(tokens_per_group, num_nodes)`: Packs groups onto nodes.\n- `log2mlog = ...`: Maps logical experts to the \"micro-logical\" experts within each node.\n- `replicate_experts(tokens_per_mlog, num_physical_experts // num_nodes)`: Replicates micro-logical experts within nodes.\n- `tokens_per_phy = (tokens_per_mlog / mlogcnt).gather(-1, phy2mlog)`: Calculates load for physical experts.\n- `balanced_packing(tokens_per_phy, num_gpus // num_nodes)`: Packs physical experts onto GPUs.\n\nThe structure seems reasonable for a hierarchical approach. The key is the efficiency of `balanced_packing` and `replicate_experts`.\n\nThe changes proposed address the efficiency and logical correctness of the core kernels.\n\nOne minor improvement: the `replicate_experts` function has `arangen = torch.arange(n, dtype=torch.int64, device=device)`. This `n` is `num_layers`. The `logcnt` and `weight` tensors are indexed by `[arangen, redundant_indices]`. This is correct.\n\nLet's consider the `rebalance_experts` function's handling of `num_groups`.\nIf `num_groups % num_nodes == 0`, it calls `rebalance_experts_hierarchical`.\nElse, it calls `rebalance_experts_hierarchical(..., num_groups=1, num_nodes=1, num_gpus=num_gpus)`. This effectively makes it a global load-balancing policy. This logic is fine.\n\nThe most critical change is the logical correction in `replicate_experts` to use `argmin` instead of `max`. This will directly impact the quality of load balancing and potentially speed if the greedy choices become more efficient.\n\nThe optimization in `balanced_packing` should also yield some speedup.\n\n```python\n# EVOLVE-BLOCK-START\n\nimport torch\n\n\ndef balanced_packing(weight: torch.Tensor,\n                     num_packs: int) -> tuple[torch.Tensor, torch.Tensor]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Pack n weighted objects to m packs, such that each bin contains exactly\n    n/m objects and the weights of all packs are as balanced as possible.\n\n    Parameters:\n        weight: [X, n], the weight of each item\n        num_packs: number of packs\n\n    Returns:\n        pack_index: [X, n], the pack index of each item\n        rank_in_pack: [X, n], the rank of the item in the pack\n    \"\"\"\n    num_layers, num_groups = weight.shape\n    assert num_groups % num_packs == 0\n    groups_per_pack = num_groups // num_packs\n\n    if groups_per_pack == 1:\n        pack_index = torch.arange(weight.size(-1),\n                                  dtype=torch.int64,\n                                  device=weight.device).expand(weight.shape)\n        rank_in_pack = torch.zeros_like(weight, dtype=torch.int64)\n        return pack_index, rank_in_pack\n\n    # Sort groups by weight in descending order.\n    # 'weight' is already float and on CPU from rebalance_experts,\n    # so no need for .float().cpu() here.\n    indices = weight.sort(-1, descending=True).indices\n\n    # Initialize pack_index and rank_in_pack.\n    # These will be fully populated, so `empty_like` is sufficient.\n    # They will be on the same device as 'weight' (i.e., CPU).\n    pack_index = torch.empty_like(weight, dtype=torch.int64)\n    rank_in_pack = torch.empty_like(pack_index)\n    \n    # Initialize tensors to hold pack weights and item counts for all layers.\n    # These tensors are on the same device as 'weight' (which is CPU).\n    pack_weights_per_layer = torch.zeros(\n        num_layers, num_packs, dtype=weight.dtype, device=weight.device)\n    pack_items_per_layer = torch.zeros(\n        num_layers, num_packs, dtype=torch.int64, device=weight.device)\n\n    # Iterate over each layer.
