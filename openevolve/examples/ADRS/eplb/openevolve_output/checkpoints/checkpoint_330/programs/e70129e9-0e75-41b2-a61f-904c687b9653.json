The `balancedness_score` remains consistent, suggesting the core load balancing logic is stable but its implementation might be inefficient.\n\nThe primary area for improvement identified is the `balanced_packing` function. This function uses nested Python loops (`for i in range(num_layers):` and `for group_id in indices[i]:`) to perform a greedy assignment. While the operations within the inner loop (`torch.where`, `torch.argmin`, indexing) are PyTorch operations, the Python loops themselves introduce significant overhead, especially for large `num_layers` and `num_groups`. Furthermore, the `.item()` call on `torch.argmin` forces a CPU-GPU synchronization per iteration, which is detrimental to performance.\n\nThe proposed improvement vectorizes the inner loop of `balanced_packing`. Instead of iterating through each layer and then each group sequentially in Python, the new approach iterates through the \"rank\" of the groups (from heaviest to lightest). In each iteration, it processes the `k`-th heaviest group for *all* layers simultaneously using vectorized PyTorch operations. This significantly reduces the Python overhead and avoids unnecessary CPU-GPU synchronizations, leading to a substantial improvement in `speed_score` while preserving the `balancedness_score` as the underlying greedy algorithm remains the same.\n\nSpecifically, the changes are:\n1.  **Vectorize the main loop in `balanced_packing`**: Replace the nested Python loops over `num_layers` and `num_groups` with a single Python loop over `num_groups`. Inside this loop, all operations (finding the next group, calculating candidate pack weights, finding the best pack, and updating pack states) are vectorized across all `num_layers`.\n2.  **Avoid `.item()`**: The `torch.argmin` result no longer needs to be converted to a Python scalar, as subsequent operations are vectorized.\n3.  **Optimize `torch.inf` creation**: The `inf_tensor` is now created once outside the loop, preventing redundant tensor creations.\n\nThese changes directly target the `speed_score` by making the algorithm's execution more efficient on the GPU. The `balancedness_score` should be unaffected as the logical steps of the greedy packing algorithm are preserved.\n\n```python\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    # Iterate over each layer.
