This suggests a regression, possibly due to recent changes or how the algorithm interacts with the environment.\n\nUpon analysis, the most prominent issue affecting performance and potentially accuracy is the explicit transfer of the `weight` tensor to CPU at the beginning of the `rebalance_experts` function via `weight.float().cpu()`. This forces all subsequent `torch` operations within `rebalance_experts_hierarchical` and `balanced_packing` to run on the CPU, even if a GPU is available. While the `replicate_experts` function uses Python's `heapq` (which is CPU-bound), performing other tensor operations on the CPU introduces unnecessary overhead and data transfer costs. Furthermore, casting to `float()` (i.e., `float32`) and moving to CPU might subtly affect numerical precision compared to GPU operations, which could impact the greedy choices in balancing, leading to a poorer `balancedness_score`.\n\n**Proposed Improvements:**\n\n1.  **Eliminate unnecessary CPU transfer:** Modify `rebalance_experts` to keep the `weight` tensor on its original device (likely GPU) for as long as possible. Only convert to `float` dtype if necessary, but avoid `cpu()`. This will allow `torch` operations in `balanced_packing` and other parts to leverage GPU acceleration.\n2.  **Explicit scalar extraction for `heapq`:** In `replicate_experts`, when passing values to `heapq` (which operates on Python scalars), explicitly call `.item()` on the `torch.Tensor` scalars. This ensures that only the necessary scalar data is moved to CPU for the heap operations, minimizing data transfer overhead.\n\nThese changes aim to improve both `speed_score` by reducing CPU bound operations and data transfers, and potentially `balancedness_score` by maintaining numerical precision on the original device (e.g., GPU) and ensuring consistent behavior of the greedy algorithm.\n\n**Detailed Changes:**\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    weight = weight.float().cpu()\n=======\n    # Ensure weight is float for calculations, but keep on original device\n    weight = weight.float()\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n            score = weight[i, j] / 1.0 \n            heapq.heappush(min_heap_row, (-score.item(), j, 1)) # Push scalar score\n=======\n            score = weight[i, j].item() / 1.0 \n            heapq.heappush(min_heap_row, (-score, j, 1)) # Push scalar score\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n                next_score = weight[i, best_log_idx] / (rank_val + 1.0)\n                heapq.heappush(min_heap_row, (-next_score.item(), best_log_idx, rank_val + 1))\n=======\n                next_score = weight[i, best_log_idx].item() / (rank_val + 1.0)\n                heapq.heappush(min_heap_row, (-next_score, best_log_idx, rank_val + 1))\n>>>>>>> REPLACE"]}}}
