The `balancedness_score` is already quite good. The primary goal is to improve the efficiency of the algorithm without sacrificing load balancing quality.\n\nThe core of the expert rearrangement algorithm lies in `balanced_packing` and `replicate_experts`. Both functions involve iterative greedy assignments which can be computationally intensive, especially when dealing with large numbers of experts or layers. The `weight` tensor is explicitly moved to CPU at the start of `rebalance_experts`, meaning all subsequent tensor operations are performed on the CPU. For large-scale problems, this can be a bottleneck.\n\nHere are two targeted improvements focusing on optimizing the inner loops of these functions:\n\n1.  **Optimize `replicate_experts` by incrementally updating average loads:**\n    The current `replicate_experts` function recomputes `(weight / logcnt)` entirely in each iteration of its main loop. This involves a large number of floating-point divisions (`num_layers * num_logical_experts` per iteration). By initializing `current_avg_load` once and then updating only the `n` elements that change in each step, we can significantly reduce the number of division operations. While the `max(dim=-1)` operation still requires scanning the full `num_log` dimension, reducing the division overhead will contribute to a better `speed_score`. This change does not alter the greedy logic, so `balancedness_score` should remain unaffected.\n\n2.  **Optimize `balanced_packing` by using `torch.where`:**\n    In `balanced_packing`, the inner loop currently creates a `clone()` of `current_pack_weights`, then masks it with `float('inf')` before finding the `argmin`. While `num_packs` is typically small, performing `clone()` and subsequent masking `num_layers * num_groups` times can add up. Using `torch.where` allows us to achieve the same masking effect without an explicit `clone()` and potentially with better constant factors due to being a single, fused operation. This improves readability and offers a minor speedup. This change also does not alter the core greedy logic, preserving the `balancedness_score`.\n\nThese changes aim to make the existing greedy algorithm more efficient, directly addressing the `speed_score` regression.\n\n---\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        arangen = torch.arange(n, dtype=torch.int64, device=device)\n        for i in range(num_log, num_phy):\n            redundant_indices = (weight / logcnt).max(dim=-1).indices\n            phy2log[:, i] = redundant_indices\n            rank[:, i] = logcnt[arangen, redundant_indices]\n            logcnt[arangen, redundant_indices] += 1\n=======\n        arangen = torch.arange(n, dtype=torch.int64, device=device)\n\n        # Initialize current average load for all experts\n        # Ensure logcnt is cast to the same dtype as weight for division\n        current_avg_load = weight / logcnt.to(weight.dtype)\n\n        for i in range(num_log, num_phy):\n            # Find the expert with the maximum average load for each layer\n            # This operation still scans the full dimension, but the division is no longer recomputed for all elements\n            redundant_indices = current_avg_load.max(dim=-1).indices\n\n            # Assign the physical expert\n            phy2log[:, i] = redundant_indices\n            rank[:, i] = logcnt[arangen, redundant_indices]\n\n            # Increment the count for the chosen logical experts\n            logcnt[arangen, redundant_indices] += 1\n\n            # Update the average load ONLY for the experts that were just replicated\n            # This avoids recomputing the division for all experts in every iteration\n            current_avg_load[arangen, redundant_indices] = \\\n                weight[arangen, redundant_indices] / logcnt[arangen, redundant_indices].to(weight.dtype)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n            # Find the pack with the minimum current weight among available ones.\n            # Set weights of full packs to infinity to exclude them from argmin.\n            temp_pack_weights = current_pack_weights.clone()\n            full_mask = (current_pack_items == groups_per_pack)\n            temp_pack_weights[full_mask] = float('inf')\n            \n            # Find the index of the pack with the minimum weight.\n            # This will always find an available pack as long as there are items left to assign.\n            pack = torch.argmin(temp_pack_weights).item()\n=======\n            # Find the pack with the minimum current weight among available ones.\n            # Use torch.where to set weights of full packs to infinity without cloning,\n            # which can be slightly more efficient and concise.\n            pack = torch.argmin(\n                torch.where(current_pack_items == groups_per_pack,\n                            float('inf'),  # Set full packs to infinity\n                            current_pack_weights)).item()\n>>>>>>> REPLACE"]}}}
