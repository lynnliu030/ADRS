Each SEARCH section must exactly match code in the current program.\nBe thoughtful about your changes and explain your reasoning thoroughly.\n\nIMPORTANT: Do not rewrite the entire program - focus on targeted improvements.\n", "responses": ["The current program's performance metrics (balancedness_score: 0.0244, speed_score: 0.0220, combined_score: 0.0232) are significantly lower than the top-performing programs (e.g., combined_score: 0.1872). This suggests a regression in both load balancing quality and execution speed.\n\nThe primary area for improvement identified is the efficiency of the `balanced_packing` function. Currently, it iterates over each layer and uses Python's `heapq` module for greedy assignment. This involves frequent Python-level operations and data transfers, which can be a major bottleneck, especially for a large number of layers.\n\nMy proposed improvement focuses on vectorizing the `balanced_packing` function using a well-known \"snake\" pattern heuristic for load balancing. This replaces the Python loop and `heapq` calls with efficient, fully-vectorized PyTorch tensor operations. This change is expected to drastically improve the `speed_score` by reducing Python overhead and leveraging Torch's optimized operations.\n\nRegarding `balancedness_score`, the \"snake\" pattern is a robust heuristic for this type of partitioning problem. While the original `heapq`-based approach is an implementation of the Longest Processing Time (LPT) algorithm (a 4/3-approximation for makespan), the \"snake\" pattern often performs comparably well in practice and is much simpler to vectorize. Given the current low `balancedness_score`, a different, more efficient heuristic might even yield better results if the previous implementation had subtle issues.\n\nThe `replicate_experts` function still uses `heapq` and Python loops. While this is also a candidate for vectorization, it's more complex due to the dynamic nature of the expert \"scores.\" For this iteration, I prioritize fixing the most obvious performance bottleneck in `balanced_packing`. The `weight.float().cpu()` call in `rebalance_experts` remains necessary because `replicate_experts` currently relies on CPU-based `heapq` operations.\n\nAdditionally, a minor simplification is applied to the `inverse` helper function for better readability.\n\n**Reasoning for Changes:**\n\n1.  **`balanced_packing` Vectorization:**\n    *   **Problem:** The original `balanced_packing` iterates `num_layers` times, and within each iteration, it performs `num_groups` heap operations (pop and push). This is `O(num_layers * num_groups * log(num_packs))` with high constant factors due to Python overhead and scalar-tensor conversions.\n    *   **Solution:** Replace the loop and `heapq` with a vectorized \"snake\" pattern assignment. This involves:\n        *   Sorting the weights once per layer to get `sorted_indices`.\n        *   Generating `pack_id` and `rank_in_pack` based on the sorted position (`k_indices`) using vectorized arithmetic and `torch.where` for the snake pattern.\n        *   Using `scatter_` to map these assignments back to the original expert indices.\n    *   **Expected Impact:** Significant improvement in `speed_score` by leveraging efficient PyTorch tensor operations. The `balancedness_score` is expected to improve or remain competitive, as the \"snake\" pattern is a well-regarded load balancing heuristic.\n\n2.  **`inverse` function simplification:**\n    *   **Problem:** The `torch.arange(...).expand(perm.shape)` is functionally correct but can be written more concisely.\n    *   **Solution:** Use `values.unsqueeze(0).expand_as(perm)` which is slightly more idiomatic PyTorch for expanding a 1D tensor to match the shape of another.\n    *   **Expected Impact:** Minor readability improvement, no significant performance change (it's not a bottleneck).\n\nThese changes aim to directly address the performance regression and improve the efficiency of the core load balancing algorithm.\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    # Sort groups by weight in descending order.\n    # 'weight' is already float and on CPU from rebalance_experts,\n    # so no need for .float().cpu() here.\n    indices = weight.sort(-1, descending=True).indices\n\n    # Initialize pack_index and rank_in_pack.\n    pack_index = torch.empty_like(weight, dtype=torch.int64)\n    rank_in_pack = torch.empty_like(pack_index)\n    \n    # Initialize tensors to hold pack weights and item counts for all layers.\n    pack_weights_per_layer = torch.zeros(\n        num_layers, num_packs, dtype=weight.dtype, device=weight.device)\n    pack_items_per_layer = torch.zeros(\n        num_layers, num_packs, dtype=torch.int64, device=weight.device)\n\n    # Iterate over each layer.
