Please clone() the tensor before performing the operation.\" This error typically arises when multiple operations attempt to write to the same memory location within a tensor concurrently without proper handling.\n\nThe error seems to originate from the `rebalance_experts_hierarchical` function, specifically within the `replicate_experts` helper function, and potentially in the way `log2phy` is populated.\n\nHere's a plan to address the error and improve performance:\n\n1.  **Address the Tensor Memory Error:**\n    *   **Identify the problematic assignment:** The error message points to a write operation where multiple elements refer to the same memory location. This is often seen when using `scatter_` or direct indexing on a tensor that is a view or has overlapping memory.\n    *   **Solution:** Ensure that when modifying `phy2log`, `rank`, `logcnt`, or `log2phy`, we are not creating aliasing issues. Cloning tensors before modification or using operations that handle this correctly (like `scatter_` with unique target indices) is crucial.\n\n2.  **Improve Efficiency and Balancedness:**\n    *   **Revisit `replicate_experts`:** The current implementation of `replicate_experts` iterates through logical experts and greedily assigns replicas. This might not be optimal for balancing. The DeepSeek EPLB paper mentions using a min-heap or sorting for better load balancing when creating replicas.\n    *   **Optimize `balanced_packing`:** The `balanced_packing` function uses a greedy approach. While generally good, for edge cases or specific weight distributions, a more sophisticated bin-packing algorithm could yield better balancedness. However, given the NP-hard nature, the current greedy approach is a reasonable trade-off. The current implementation of `balanced_packing` is already quite optimized by using scalar `inf` and avoiding repeated tensor allocations.\n    *   **Data Movement:** The code currently casts `weight` to `float()` at the beginning. If the input `weight` is already on the CPU, this is fine. If it's on the GPU, moving it to the CPU might introduce overhead. It's better to perform operations on the original device if possible, or explicitly manage device placement. However, the comment suggests that `weight` is already on CPU, so this might not be the primary bottleneck.\n\nLet's focus on fixing the error first, as it prevents the code from running.\n\n```python\n# The error \"unsupported operation: more than one element of the written-to tensor refers to a single memory location\"\n# typically happens when you try to write to the same memory location through different slices or views of a tensor\n# simultaneously without cloning.\n#\n# In `replicate_experts`, the line:\n# phy2log[:, i] = redundant_indices\n# rank[:, i] = logcnt[arangen, redundant_indices]\n#\n# and in `rebalance_experts_hierarchical` when populating `pphy2mlog` and `pphy2log`:\n# pphy2mlog = (pphy2mlog.view(num_layers, num_nodes, -1) + torch.arange(\n#     0,\n#     num_logical_experts,\n#     num_logical_experts // num_nodes,\n#     device=group_pack_index.device,\n# ).view(1, -1, 1)).flatten(-2)\n# pphy2log = mlog2log.gather(-1, pphy2mlog)\n#\n# and especially in `rebalance_experts`:\n# log2phy.view(num_layers, -1).scatter_(\n#     -1,\n#     phy2log * maxlogcnt + phyrank,\n#     torch.arange(num_replicas, dtype=torch.int64,\n#                  device=log2phy.device).expand(num_layers, -1),\n# )\n#\n# The scatter operation with potentially overlapping target indices is a prime suspect.\n# We need to ensure that the indices provided to scatter are unique for each write.\n#\n# Let's analyze the `replicate_experts` first.\n# `redundant_indices` is a tensor of shape [n] (where n=num_layers).\n# `logcnt` is [n, num_log].\n# `phy2log[:, i]` is being assigned `redundant_indices`.
