The `speed_score` has also regressed.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the `replicate_experts` function and potential inefficiencies in `balanced_packing`.\n\n**Analysis of `replicate_experts` (Impacts `balancedness_score`):**\n\nThe current `replicate_experts` function contains a comment:\n`# The original code used .max(dim=-1).indices, which seems incorrect for load balancing.`\n`# We replace it with .argmin() to select the least loaded expert.`\n\nHowever, the stated goal for replication in load balancing scenarios like this is typically to **minimize the maximum load**. To achieve this, one should add replicas to the logical experts that currently have the **highest average load**. By adding a replica to the most heavily loaded expert, its load is distributed among more physical experts, thereby reducing its average load and contributing to a more balanced overall distribution.\n\nIf `(weight / logcnt)` represents the average load per replica for each logical expert, then `argmin` would select the *least* loaded expert, making it even lighter relative to others. This would worsen the imbalance, which aligns with the observed `balancedness_score` regression. Conversely, `argmax` would select the *most* loaded expert, which is the correct greedy strategy to reduce the peak load.\n\nTherefore, the change from `max` (or `argmax`) to `argmin` was likely the cause of the `balancedness_score` regression. Reverting this change is crucial for improving load balancing.\n\n**Analysis of `balanced_packing` (Impacts `speed_score`):**\n\nThe `balanced_packing` function iterates through layers and then through sorted groups. Inside the inner loop, it uses `torch.where` with `torch.full_like(current_pack_weights, float('inf'))` to create `candidate_weights`. `torch.full_like` and `torch.where` both create new tensors in each iteration of the inner loop (`num_layers * num_groups` times), which can be inefficient for performance.\n\nOptimizing this by pre-allocating or using in-place modification can reduce memory allocations and improve execution speed.\n\n**Proposed Changes:**\n\n1.  **Correct Expert Replication Strategy:** Change `argmin` to `argmax` in `replicate_experts` to ensure replicas are added to the most heavily loaded experts, improving `balancedness_score`.\n2.  **Optimize `balanced_packing` Loop:** Replace `torch.where` and repeated `torch.full_like` calls with a more efficient `clone()` and direct assignment to reduce temporary tensor creation, improving `speed_score`.\n3.  **Remove Redundant `.cpu()` Call:** In `balanced_packing`, the `weight` tensor is already moved to CPU in `rebalance_experts`, so `weight.float().sort(...).indices.cpu()` has a redundant `.cpu()` call. Removing it is a minor cleanup for efficiency.\n\n---\n\n```diff\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        # The original code used .max(dim=-1).indices, which seems incorrect for load balancing.\n        # We replace it with .argmin() to select the least loaded expert.\n        redundant_indices = (weight / logcnt).argmin(dim=-1)\n=======\n        # To minimize the maximum load, we should add replicas to the\n        # logical experts with the maximum current average load.\n        # This strategy ensures that the most heavily loaded experts\n        # are prioritized for replication to reduce their load.\n        redundant_indices = (weight / logcnt).argmax(dim=-1)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    indices = weight.float().sort(-1, descending=True).indices.cpu()\n=======\n    # weight is already on CPU from rebalance_experts, so .cpu() is redundant.\n    indices = weight.float().sort(-1, descending=True).indices\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n            # Set weights of unavailable packs to infinity to exclude them from argmin.\n            candidate_weights = torch.where(available_mask, current_pack_weights,\n                                            torch.full_like(current_pack_weights, float('inf')))\n            \n            # Use torch.argmin to find the index of the pack with the minimum weight.\n            # .item() converts the 0-dim tensor result to a Python scalar.\n            pack = torch.argmin(candidate_weights).item()\n=======\n            # Create candidate_weights by copying current_pack_weights and\n            # setting unavailable pack weights to infinity to exclude them from argmin.\n            # This avoids repeated allocations of full_like or where inside the inner loop.\n            candidate_weights = current_pack_weights.clone()\n            candidate_weights[~available_mask] = float('inf')\n\n            # Use torch.argmin to find the index of the pack with the minimum weight.\n            # .item() converts the 0-dim tensor result to a Python scalar.\n            pack = torch.argmin(candidate_weights).item()\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```"]}}}
