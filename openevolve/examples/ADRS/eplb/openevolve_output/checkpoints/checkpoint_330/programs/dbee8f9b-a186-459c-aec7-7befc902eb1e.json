It first packs groups of experts to nodes, then replicates experts within nodes, and finally packs these replicated experts to GPUs. While this approach is sophisticated, it seems to have led to a regression in all performance metrics compared to previous versions.\n\nMy analysis suggests the following areas for improvement:\n\n1.  **Simplification of Hierarchical Logic:** The current hierarchical logic, especially in `rebalance_experts_hierarchical`, involves complex tensor manipulations and reshaping. Simplifying this logic could improve both readability and potentially performance by reducing overhead.\n2.  **Revisiting the Global Policy:** The `else` block in `rebalance_experts` calls `rebalance_experts_hierarchical` with `num_groups=1`, `num_nodes=1`. This effectively makes it a global load balancing policy. It might be beneficial to have a distinct, potentially simpler, global balancing function that is optimized for this scenario, rather than shoehorning it into the hierarchical structure. This could also address the observed performance regression in the global policy.\n3.  **Optimization of `balanced_packing`:** The `balanced_packing` function is called multiple times. Optimizing its core logic or exploring alternative packing algorithms could yield significant performance gains. Given that perfect load balancing is NP-hard, a good heuristic that is faster might be preferable.\n4.  **Data Movement:** The code explicitly moves `weight` to CPU (`weight.float().cpu()`). While this might be necessary for certain operations, it's worth examining if any of these operations can be performed on the GPU to reduce data transfer overhead.\n\nBased on these points, I propose the following changes:\n\n### Change 1: Streamline `rebalance_experts_hierarchical` by simplifying group-to-node packing.\n\nThe current approach of calculating `tokens_per_group` and then using `balanced_packing` for groups to nodes is complex. A more direct approach could be to sort the groups directly and assign them to nodes. This might simplify the logic and reduce intermediate tensor creation.\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    # Step 1: pack groups to nodes\n    tokens_per_group = weight.unflatten(-1, (num_groups, group_size)).sum(-1)\n    group_pack_index, group_rank_in_pack = balanced_packing(\n        tokens_per_group, num_nodes)\n    log2mlog = (((group_pack_index * groups_per_node + group_rank_in_pack) *\n                 group_size).unsqueeze(-1) +\n                torch.arange(group_size,\n                             dtype=torch.int64,\n                             device=group_pack_index.device)).flatten(-2)\n    mlog2log = inverse(log2mlog)\n\n    #

We can explore minor optimizations within it, such as using `torch.bucketize` if applicable or ensuring that tensor operations are vectorized effectively. The current use of `torch.where` for setting full packs to infinity is a good step.\n\nOne potential area is the inner loop that iterates through `group_id` in `indices[i]`. If `groups_per_pack` is large, this loop could be a bottleneck. However, the logic is inherently sequential for greedy assignment.\n\nLet's consider if the `torch.argmin` can be made more efficient. The current implementation uses `torch.where` which is good.\n\nA more significant change might be to use a different packing algorithm, but without knowing the exact previous performance metrics, it's safer to stick with minor optimizations.\n\nFor now, I will focus on the structural changes. If performance is still an issue, `balanced_packing` would be the next target.\n\n### Change 4: Move operations to GPU where possible.\n\nThe `weight.float().cpu()` call forces all operations to CPU. If `weight` is already on GPU, it might be beneficial to keep it there for as long as possible. However, `balanced_packing` might require CPU operations for sorting or argmin if the GPU implementation is not as efficient or available.\n\nGiven the current performance metrics, the main issue seems to be the complexity and potential inefficiencies in the hierarchical logic and the global fallback. The proposed changes aim to address these first.\n\n### Explanation of Proposed Changes:\n\n1.  **Streamlined `rebalance_experts_hierarchical`:** The original implementation of `rebalance_experts_hierarchical` involved complex tensor manipulations to prepare the data for `replicate_experts` and then to map it back. The revised version attempts to simplify this by directly calculating the group-to-node assignments based on sorted weights and then reconstructing the necessary mappings (`mlog2log`, `phy2orig_log_expert_idx`, etc.) more directly. This reduces the number of intermediate tensors and complex `gather` operations. The goal is to make the logic more transparent and potentially faster.\n2.  **Dedicated `rebalance_experts_global`:** The original code used the hierarchical function for the global case, which is sub-optimal. By introducing a dedicated `rebalance_experts_global` function that directly calls `replicate_experts` (which is well-suited for global replication), we simplify the logic and potentially improve the performance of the global fallback strategy. This also makes the code's intent clearer.\n3.  **Handling `maxlogcnt`:** Added `max(..., 1)` to `maxlogcnt` calculation to prevent issues when `num_replicas == num_logical_experts`.\n\nThese changes are aimed at improving both the balancedness and speed scores by simplifying the complex hierarchical logic and providing a more efficient global fallback. The reduction in tensor operations and clearer logic are expected to contribute to better performance and maintainability."]}}}
