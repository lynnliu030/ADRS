The current performance metrics show a significant regression in `speed_score` compared to previous attempts. Upon reviewing the provided code, the most significant bottleneck for performance appears to be the nested Python loops within the `balanced_packing` function.\n\nThe `balanced_packing` function currently iterates over `num_layers` (outer loop) and then `num_groups` (inner loop). Inside the inner loop, it performs a greedy assignment of an expert group to the least loaded available pack. While the greedy algorithm itself is a reasonable heuristic for load balancing, performing these assignments one by one in Python loops across potentially large `num_layers` and `num_groups` dimensions is highly inefficient in PyTorch, which is optimized for vectorized operations on tensors.\n\n**Proposed Improvement:**\nThe main improvement will be to vectorize the `balanced_packing` function. Instead of iterating through each layer and then each group sequentially, we can restructure the algorithm to:\n1. Sort groups by weight for all layers simultaneously (this is already vectorized).\n2. Iterate `num_groups` times (once for each \"rank\" of heaviest groups). In each iteration, process the `k`-th heaviest group *for all layers at once* using vectorized PyTorch operations. This means operations like finding the minimum-loaded pack and updating pack weights/counts will be performed in parallel across all `num_layers`.\n\n**Detailed Changes and Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Vectorize `balanced_packing`:**\n    *   The outer `for i in range(num_layers)` loop will be removed.\n    *   The inner `for group_id in indices[i]` loop will be replaced by a `for k in range(num_groups)` loop.\n    *   Inside this new loop, we will select the `k`-th heaviest group ID and its weight for *all* layers simultaneously using tensor indexing.\n    *   The logic to find the minimum-loaded pack will be applied across all layers in parallel. Instead of filtering available packs with `torch.nonzero` and then indexing, we will mask full packs by setting their weights to `float('inf')` and then use `torch.argmin(dim=1)` to find the best pack for each layer. This is generally more efficient on GPUs.\n    *   Updates to `pack_index`, `rank_in_pack`, `pack_weights_per_layer`, and `pack_items_per_layer` will use advanced indexing and `scatter_add_` operations, which are highly optimized for parallel execution on PyTorch's backend.\n\n**Expected Impact:**\n\n*   **`speed_score` Improvement:** This change is expected to significantly reduce the execution time of the `rebalance_experts` function. Replacing Python loops with vectorized tensor operations is a fundamental optimization technique in PyTorch and will drastically cut down CPU-GPU communication overhead and leverage GPU parallelism.\n*   **`balancedness_score`:** The underlying greedy algorithm logic remains the same. Therefore, the `balancedness_score` should be preserved, as the mathematical outcome of the expert assignment process is identical. Any minor differences would be due to floating-point precision variations in the order of operations, but the overall solution quality should not degrade.\n*   **Readability/Maintainability:** While the vectorized code might initially look denser, it represents the algorithm more idiomatically in PyTorch, which can improve maintainability for developers familiar with tensor programming. The removal of explicit Python loops over tensor elements makes the code less prone to performance pitfalls.\n\n**Diff:**\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    # Sort groups by weight in descending order.\n    # 'weight' is already float and on CPU from rebalance_experts,\n    # so no need for .float().cpu() here.\n    indices = weight.sort(-1, descending=True).indices\n\n    # Initialize pack_index and rank_in_pack.\n    # These will be fully populated, so `empty_like` is sufficient.\n    # They will be on the same device as 'weight' (i.e., CPU).\n    pack_index = torch.empty_like(weight, dtype=torch.int64)\n    rank_in_pack = torch.empty_like(pack_index)\n    \n    # Initialize tensors to hold pack weights and item counts for all layers.\n    # These tensors are on the same device as 'weight' (which is CPU).\n    pack_weights_per_layer = torch.zeros(\n        num_layers, num_packs, dtype=weight.dtype, device=weight.device)\n    pack_items_per_layer = torch.zeros(\n        num_layers, num_packs, dtype=torch.int64, device=weight.device)\n\n    # Iterate over each layer.
