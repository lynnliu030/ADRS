Each SEARCH section must exactly match code in the current program.\nBe thoughtful about your changes and explain your reasoning thoroughly.\n\nIMPORTANT: Do not rewrite the entire program - focus on targeted improvements.\n", "responses": ["The current performance metrics show a significant regression in both `balancedness_score` and `speed_score` compared to previous top-performing programs. Curiously, the \"Current Program\" is identical to \"Program 1,\" which previously achieved higher scores. This suggests that the regression might stem from changes in the testing environment, input data characteristics, or metric calculation rather than a direct code change.\n\nHowever, as the task is to improve the *program itself*, I will focus on refining the existing algorithm. Upon detailed analysis of the `rebalance_experts`, `balanced_packing`, and `replicate_experts` functions, the core logic for load balancing (greedy assignment to the least loaded resource) is implemented using highly vectorized PyTorch operations where possible.\n\n*   **`replicate_experts`**: This function uses an iterative greedy approach, where in each step, it identifies the logical expert(s) with the highest load-to-replica ratio (one per layer, thanks to `dim=-1` in `torch.max`) and increments their replica count. This approach is already vectorized across layers and uses efficient PyTorch primitives. Its complexity is `O(num_redundant * num_layers * num_logical_experts_per_node)`, which, given typical parameter ranges, should be quite fast (e.g., hundreds of thousands of operations). There's no obvious way to make this faster without changing the greedy strategy itself (e.g., a \"k-greedy\" approach that processes multiple steps at once, but this would likely harm `balancedness_score`), or by implementing a custom PyTorch C++/CUDA priority queue, which is out of scope for a simple search/replace.\n\n*   **`balanced_packing`**: This function also uses a greedy strategy (First Fit Decreasing variant) to assign groups to packs. It iterates through layers and then through sorted groups within each layer. The inner `argmin` operation over `num_packs` elements is efficient. The overall complexity is `O(num_layers * num_groups * (log(num_groups) + num_packs))`, which also appears to be efficient enough.\n\nThe primary areas for minor improvement, aligning with the \"simplify code to improve readability and maintainability\" suggestion, involve removing redundant checks and Python scalar conversions, which might offer a marginal speedup by reducing Python interpreter overhead.\n\n### Proposed Change 1: Simplify `balanced_packing`\n\nThe `balanced_packing` function has an `if/else` block that checks `if available_pack_indices.numel() > 0:`. Given the problem constraints (`num_groups % num_packs == 0`) and the loop structure (all groups must be packed), this `else` branch should never be reached if the inputs are valid. Removing this redundant check simplifies the code and removes a potential (though unlikely) runtime error path. Additionally, converting the `pack` index from a 0-dimensional tensor to a Python scalar using `.item()` inside the inner loop is an unnecessary Python overhead. Keeping it as a 0-dimensional tensor allows PyTorch to handle the indexing more efficiently.\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n            # If there are available packs, find the one with the minimum weight.\n            if available_pack_indices.numel() > 0:\n                # Get weights of only the available packs\n                weights_of_available_packs = current_pack_weights[available_pack_indices]\n                \n                # Find the index within `available_pack_indices` that has the minimum weight.\n                local_min_idx = torch.argmin(weights_of_available_packs)\n                \n                # Map this local index back to the global pack index.\n                pack = available_pack_indices[local_min_idx].item()\n            else:\n                # This case should ideally not be reached if inputs are valid and logic is correct.\n                # For robustness, we can break or raise an error, but here we assume valid inputs.\n                # If it happens, it means no pack has capacity, which implies an issue with `groups_per_pack` or `current_pack_items`.\n                # For now, we'll assume it won't happen based on the problem constraints.\n                # If this assertion fails, it means there's a problem with the logic or input assumptions.\n                raise RuntimeError(\"No available packs found, but expected to find one.\")\n\n            # Assign the group to the chosen pack.\n            # `group_id` is a 0-dim tensor, which can be directly used for indexing.\n            pack_index[i, group_id] = pack\n            rank_in_pack[i, group_id] = current_pack_items[pack]\n=======\n            # Get weights of only the available packs\n            weights_of_available_packs = current_pack_weights[available_pack_indices]\n            \n            # Find the index within `available_pack_indices` that has the minimum weight.\n            local_min_idx = torch.argmin(weights_of_available_packs)\n            \n            # Map this local index back to the global pack index.\n            # Keep `pack` as a 0-dim tensor to avoid Python scalar conversion overhead.\n            pack = available_pack_indices[local_min_idx]\n\n            # Assign the group to the chosen pack.\n            # `group_id` is a 0-dim tensor, which can be directly used for indexing.\n            pack_index[i, group_id] = pack\n            rank_in_pack[i, group_id] = current_pack_items[pack]\n>>>>>>> REPLACE"]}}}
