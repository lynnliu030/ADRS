The goal is to improve these scores while maintaining or improving the `balancedness_score`.\n\nThe `rebalance_experts` function calls `rebalance_experts_hierarchical`. Within `rebalance_experts_hierarchical`, the `balanced_packing` function is called multiple times. The `balanced_packing` function uses a greedy approach to assign items to packs. While this is a good heuristic for load balancing, the way it finds the minimum weight pack can be optimized. Specifically, the current approach iterates through available packs to find the minimum weight. This can be made more efficient by using a min-heap data structure.\n\nAdditionally, the current code performs a lot of tensor operations and memory movements (e.g., `gather`, `view`, `flatten`, `unflatten`). Optimizing these operations and ensuring data stays on the most efficient device (CPU vs. GPU) can significantly improve performance.\n\nLet's analyze the `rebalance_experts_hierarchical` function and its dependencies:\n\n1.  **`rebalance_experts_hierarchical`:**\n    *   Calculates `tokens_per_group` by unflattening and summing.\n    *   Calls `balanced_packing` for groups to nodes.\n    *   Performs `gather` and `view` operations to create `tokens_per_mlog`.\n    *   Calls `replicate_experts`.\n    *   Performs `gather` and `view` operations to create `tokens_per_phy`.\n    *   Calls `balanced_packing` for physical experts to GPUs.\n    *   Performs complex indexing and reshaping to construct the final mappings.\n\n2.  **`replicate_experts`:**\n    *   Iterates `num_log` to `num_phy` times.\n    *   Inside the loop, it uses `max(dim=-1).indices` and `gather` which can be computationally intensive.\n\n3.  **`balanced_packing`:**\n    *   The core of the load balancing.\n    *   The loop `for group_id in indices[i]` iterates through sorted groups.\n    *   Inside this loop, finding the minimum weight pack involves:\n        *   `torch.nonzero(available_mask)`\n        *   `current_pack_weights[available_pack_indices]`\n        *   `torch.argmin(weights_of_available_packs)`\n    *   This part is a prime candidate for optimization using a min-heap.\n\n**Proposed Improvements:**\n\n1.  **Optimize `balanced_packing` using a Min-Heap:**\n    *   Instead of repeatedly searching for the minimum weight pack, we can maintain a min-heap of (weight, pack_index) for each layer.\n    *   When assigning a group, we extract the minimum from the heap, assign the group, update the weight, and re-insert the updated (weight, pack_index) back into the heap.\n    *   This should reduce the complexity of finding the minimum from O(num_packs) to O(log(num_packs)) per group assignment.\n\n2.  **Reduce redundant tensor operations:**\n    *   Examine where intermediate tensors are created and if they can be avoided or reused.\n    *   The `gather` and `view` operations are common. We need to ensure these are efficient.\n    *   The `inverse` function uses `scatter_` which is generally efficient, but its repeated calls might add up.\n\nLet's focus on improving `balanced_packing` first, as it's called multiple times and its efficiency directly impacts the overall speed.\n\n**Detailed Plan for `balanced_packing` optimization:**\n\nThe `balanced_packing` function aims to assign `num_groups` (columns of `weight`) into `num_packs` bins, with `groups_per_pack = num_groups // num_packs` items per bin, minimizing the maximum weight of any bin.\n\nThe current logic for finding the minimum available pack:\n```python\n            # Find available packs (those not yet full).\n            available_mask = (current_pack_items < groups_per_pack)\n            available_pack_indices = torch.nonzero(available_mask).squeeze(-1)\n            weights_of_available_packs = current_pack_weights[available_pack_indices]\n            local_min_idx = torch.argmin(weights_of_available_packs).item()\n            pack = available_pack_indices[local_min_idx].item()\n```\nThis involves creating masks, finding non-zero indices, gathering weights, and finding the minimum. This can be replaced with a min-heap.\n\nWe can use `torch.ops.heapq.heappush` and `torch.ops.heapq.heappop` if they are available and suitable, or implement a custom heap if not. However, standard Python `heapq` might not work directly with PyTorch tensors in a performant way. A more PyTorch-native approach would be to use `torch.ops.aten::min_heap` or similar if exposed, or to manage indices and weights manually in a way that mimics heap behavior.\n\nGiven the constraints, let's consider how to adapt the existing structure. The primary bottleneck is finding the minimum. If we can maintain the `pack_weights_per_layer` and `pack_items_per_layer` efficiently, the selection of the next pack can be streamlined.\n\nThe current implementation iterates through `indices[i]`, which are sorted group IDs. For each `group_id`, it finds the best pack. This suggests that for each layer, we are essentially doing a multi-way merge of weighted items into bins.\n\nLet's reconsider the `balanced_packing` function. The objective is to assign `num_groups` items to `num_packs` bins, where each bin should ideally have `groups_per_pack` items. The greedy strategy picks the item with the largest weight and assigns it to the currently least loaded bin that still has capacity.\n\nThe current code sorts groups by weight descending. Then, for each layer, it iterates through these sorted groups. For each group, it finds the least loaded pack that is not yet full.\n\nThe inefficiency comes from `torch.nonzero(available_mask)` and then `torch.argmin` on a sub-tensor.\n\nA min-heap approach would maintain `num_packs` entries, each representing a pack's current total weight and its item count.\n\nLet's try to implement a more efficient selection mechanism within `balanced_packing` without drastically changing the overall structure, focusing on the selection of `pack`.\n\nThe current code is already on CPU for the `weight` tensor when `balanced_packing` is called. This is good, as heap operations are often CPU-bound.\n\nLet's analyze the structure again. The outer loop is `for i in range(num_layers):`. Inside, `for group_id in indices[i]:`.\n\nThe current way to find the best pack:\n```python\n            available_mask = (current_pack_items < groups_per_pack)\n            available_pack_indices = torch.nonzero(available_mask).squeeze(-1)\n            weights_of_available_packs = current_pack_weights[available_pack_indices]\n            local_min_idx = torch.argmin(weights_of_available_packs).item()\n            pack = available_pack_indices[local_min_idx].item()\n```\nThis is O(num_packs) for each `group_id`. Since there are `num_groups` groups per layer, this is O(num_layers * num_groups * num_packs).\n\nIf we use a min-heap of size `num_packs`, each selection takes O(log num_packs). Total complexity becomes O(num_layers * num_groups * log num_packs). This is a significant improvement if `num_packs` is large.\n\nHowever, `torch.ops.heapq` is not a standard public API. We might need to implement this manually using `torch.ops.aten.sort` or similar, or by managing a list of tuples and sorting it.\n\nA simpler optimization, without a full heap implementation, could be to optimize the selection of the minimum.\nInstead of:\n1.  Creating `available_mask`.\n2.  `torch.nonzero(available_mask)`.\n3.  Gathering weights from `current_pack_weights`.\n4.  `torch.argmin` on the gathered weights.\n\nWe can iterate through the packs and keep track of the minimum weight pack that is available. This avoids intermediate tensors.\n\n```python\n            # Find the pack with the minimum current weight among available ones.\n            min_weight = float('inf')\n            best_pack = -1\n            for pack_idx in range(num_packs):\n                if current_pack_items[pack_idx] < groups_per_pack:\n                    if current_pack_weights[pack_idx] < min_weight:\n                        min_weight = current_pack_weights[pack_idx]\n                        best_pack = pack_idx\n            pack = best_pack\n```\nThis approach is still O(num_packs) per group, but it avoids intermediate tensor creation and may have better constant factors.\n\nLet's consider the `replicate_experts` function.\n```python\n    for i in range(num_log, num_phy):\n        redundant_indices = (weight / logcnt).max(dim=-1).indices\n        phy2log[:, i] = redundant_indices\n        rank[:, i] = logcnt[arangen, redundant_indices]\n        logcnt[arangen, redundant_indices] += 1\n```\nThe `(weight / logcnt).max(dim=-1).indices` operation is performed `num_redundant` times. This is a bottleneck.\n`weight` is `[n, num_log]`. `logcnt` is `[n, num_log]`.\nThe division `weight / logcnt` creates a temporary tensor of size `[n, num_log]`.\nThen `max(dim=-1)` finds the index of the maximum value in each row. This is repeated for each of the `num_phy - num_log` redundant experts.\n\nA better approach for `replicate_experts` would be to:\n1.  Calculate the \"load per replica\" for each logical expert: `weight / logcnt`.\n2.  In each step of the loop, find the logical expert that, if given another replica, would have the minimum \"load per replica\".\n3.  Assign the new physical expert to that logical expert.\n4.  Update `logcnt` for that logical expert.\n\nThis sounds like a priority queue or heap again. We want to find the logical expert that would *benefit most* from an additional replica, or rather, whose *next* replica would be the least loaded.\n\nLet's refine the `replicate_experts` logic:\nWe want to assign `num_phy` physical experts to `num_log` logical experts.\nInitially, each logical expert has 1 physical expert. `logcnt` is `[n, num_log]` all ones.\nWe need to add `num_redundant = num_phy - num_log` more physical experts.\n\nConsider the current load of each logical expert: `current_load = weight / logcnt`.\nWe want to select a logical expert `j` such that `weight[:, j] / (logcnt[:, j] + 1)` is minimized.\nThis is equivalent to finding `j` that maximizes `(logcnt[:, j] + 1) / weight[:, j]`.\n\nLet's reformulate `replicate_experts`:\nWe have `num_log` logical experts and need `num_phy` physical experts.\nWe can think of this as having `num_log` \"sources\" of experts, each source `j` having a \"cost\" to produce the `k`-th replica of `weight[:, j] / k`. We want to pick `num_phy` experts such that the total cost (or max cost) is minimized.\n\nThe current implementation `(weight / logcnt).max(dim=-1).indices` is finding the *logical expert with the highest current load per replica*. This seems counter-intuitive for balancing. We should be picking the logical expert that *would have the lowest load per replica* if it received one more copy.\n\nLet's re-read the `replicate_experts` goal: \"such that the maximum load of all replicas is minimized.\"\n\nThe current code:\n`redundant_indices = (weight / logcnt).max(dim=-1).indices`\nThis selects the logical expert with the *highest* current load per replica.\nIf we assign a new physical expert to this logical expert, we are essentially increasing the load of an already highly loaded logical expert's replicas. This seems to be a mistake in the original implementation's logic for achieving minimum maximum load.\n\nTo minimize the maximum load, we should pick the logical expert that currently has the *least* load per replica, and assign the next physical expert to it.\n\nLet's correct the logic for `replicate_experts`:\n\nCurrent:\n```python\n        redundant_indices = (weight / logcnt).max(dim=-1).indices # Picks the logical expert with MAX load/replica\n        phy2log[:, i] = redundant_indices\n        rank[:, i] = logcnt[arangen, redundant_indices]\n        logcnt[arangen, redundant_indices] += 1\n```\n\nCorrected logic:\nWe want to assign the `i`-th physical expert (for `i` from `num_log` to `num_phy - 1`).\nFor each logical expert `j`, calculate the load if it gets one more replica: `new_load_j = weight[:, j] / (logcnt[:, j] + 1)`.\nWe want to find `j` that minimizes `new_load_j`.\n\nThis can be done efficiently.\nLet `load_per_replica = weight / logcnt`.\nWe want to find `logical_expert_idx` that minimizes `weight[:, logical_expert_idx] / (logcnt[:, logical_expert_idx] + 1)`.\n\nThis is equivalent to minimizing `(weight / logcnt) / (1 + 1/logcnt)`.\nOr, minimizing `weight / (logcnt + 1)`.\n\nLet's modify `replicate_experts`:\n\n```python\ndef replicate_experts(\n        weight: torch.Tensor,\n        num_phy: int) -> tuple[torch.Tensor, torch.Tensor, torch.Tensor]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Replicate `num_log` experts to `num_phy` replicas, such that the maximum\n    load of all replicas is minimized.\n\n    Parameters:\n        weight: [X, num_log]\n        num_phy: total number of experts after replication\n\n    Returns:\n        phy2log: [X, num_phy], logical expert id of each physical expert\n        rank: [X, num_phy], the replica rank\n        logcnt: [X, num_log], number of replicas for each logical expert\n    \"\"\"\n    n, num_log = weight.shape\n    num_redundant = num_phy -

The speed might improve or degrade depending on the efficiency of `argmin` vs `argmax` and the overhead of the loop.\n\nLet's consider the `balanced_packing` optimization again. The current implementation's inefficiency is in finding the minimum.\nThe `rebalance_experts_hierarchical` function calls `balanced_packing` twice:\n1.  `tokens_per_group = weight.unflatten(-1, (num_groups, group_size)).sum(-1)`\n    This creates `tokens_per_group` of shape `[num_layers, num_groups]`.\n    Then `balanced_packing(tokens_per_group, num_nodes)` is called.\n    Here, `num_groups` is the number of \"items\" and `num_nodes` is the number of \"packs\".\n    The constraint is `num_groups % num_nodes == 0`.\n    The number of groups per pack is `groups_per_pack = num_groups // num_nodes`.\n    The `weight` here is `tokens_per_group`.\n\n2.  `tokens_per_phy = (tokens_per_mlog / mlogcnt).gather(-1, phy2mlog)`\n    This creates `tokens_per_phy` which has shape `[num_layers * num_nodes, num_physical_experts // num_nodes]`.\n    `num_physical_experts // num_nodes` is the number of physical experts per GPU (if `num_gpus == num_nodes`).\n    The `balanced_packing` is called with `tokens_per_phy` and `num_gpus // num_nodes`.\n    Here, the \"items\" are `num_physical_experts // num_nodes` and \"packs\" are `num_gpus // num_nodes`.\n    The `weight` here is `tokens_per_phy`.\n\nLet's focus on optimizing the `balanced_packing` function's internal search for the minimum.\nThe current code:\n```python\n    # Iterate over each layer. The greedy assignment per layer is sequential.\n    for i in range(num_layers):\n        # For each layer, process groups in sorted order of their weights.\n        # `indices[i]` is a 1D tensor of group IDs for the current layer.\n        for group_id in indices[i]:\n            # Get current state for this layer's packs.\n            current_pack_weights = pack_weights_per_layer[i]\n            current_pack_items = pack_items_per_layer[i]\n\n            # Find available packs (those not yet full).\n            # `available_mask` is a boolean tensor.\n            available_mask = (current_pack_items < groups_per_pack)\n\n            # Find the pack with the minimum current weight among available ones.\n            # This approach avoids creating a large temporary tensor with float('inf').\n            available_pack_indices = torch.nonzero(available_mask).squeeze(-1)\n            \n            # If no available packs, something is wrong with the logic or inputs.\n            # This assert ensures correctness under expected conditions.\n            assert available_pack_indices.numel() > 0, \"No available packs found, but expected to find one.\"\n\n            # Get weights of only the available packs\n            weights_of_available_packs = current_pack_weights[available_pack_indices]\n            \n            # Find the index within the `available_pack_indices` list that has the minimum weight.\n            local_min_idx = torch.argmin(weights_of_available_packs).item()\n            \n            # Map this local index back to the global pack index.\n            pack = available_pack_indices[local_min_idx].item()\n\n            # Assert that a valid pack was found and it has space.\n            assert current_pack_items[pack] < groups_per_pack\n\n            # Assign the group to the chosen pack.\n            # `group_id` is a 0-dim tensor, which can be directly used for indexing.\n            pack_index[i, group_id] = pack\n            rank_in_pack[i, group_id] = current_pack_items[pack]\n\n            # Update pack weights and item counts for the chosen pack.\n            # `weight[i, group_id]` is the weight of the current group.\n            pack_weights_per_layer[i, pack] += weight[i, group_id]\n            pack_items_per_layer[i, pack] += 1\n```\n\nTo optimize the selection of `pack`:\nWe can maintain a list of `(weight, pack_index)` for available packs and sort it, or use a heap.\nSince we are on CPU and the number of packs might not be astronomically large, a simple iteration and tracking of min might be sufficient if we avoid intermediate tensors.\n\nThe current code already avoids `float('inf')` by using `torch.nonzero` and then selecting from `available_pack_indices`.\nThe bottleneck is `torch.nonzero` and `torch.argmin` on a potentially large subset of `current_pack_weights`.\n\nLet's try replacing the minimum finding part with a more direct loop that tracks minimum.\n\n```python\n            # Find the pack with the minimum current weight among available ones.\n            min_pack_weight = float('inf')\n            selected_pack_idx = -1\n            \n            # Iterate through all packs to find the least loaded available pack\n            for p_idx in range(num_packs):\n                if current_pack_items[p_idx] < groups_per_pack:\n                    if current_pack_weights[p_idx] < min_pack_weight:\n                        min_pack_weight = current_pack_weights[p_idx]\n                        selected_pack_idx = p_idx\n            \n            pack = selected_pack_idx\n```\nThis change replaces several tensor operations with a Python loop. This might be slower if `num_packs` is very large, but it avoids intermediate tensor creation which can have its own overhead. This is a micro-optimization and its impact depends on the typical `num_packs` value.\n\nGiven the existing performance scores, the most impactful change is likely the correction in `replicate_experts`. The `balancedness_score` is quite good (0.2983), suggesting the greedy packing is decent. The `speed_score` is low (0.0246), indicating that the execution time is high. This points to computational bottlenecks.\n\nThe `rebalance_experts_hierarchical` function has several `gather` operations and reshaping.\n`log2mlog = (((group_pack_index * groups_per_node + group_rank_in_pack) * group_size).unsqueeze(-1) + torch.arange(group_size, dtype=torch.int64, device=group_pack_index.device)).flatten(-2)`\nThis part creates intermediate indices.\n\nLet's focus on the `replicate_experts` logic correction as the primary change.\n\nOne more thought on `replicate_experts`:\nThe current code uses `(weight / logcnt).max(dim=-1).indices`.\nThis is computed `num_phy - num_log` times.\nIf we can compute all the `potential_new_loads` and then iteratively select the minimum, it might be faster.\n\nConsider the state for `replicate_experts` at step `i` (assigning the `i`-th physical expert):\nWe have `logcnt` representing the current number of replicas for each logical expert.\nWe want to find `j` that minimizes `weight[:, j] / (logcnt[:, j] + 1)`.\n\nLet's maintain a \"score\" for each logical expert representing its current \"cost per replica\", and use a min-heap to efficiently find the logical expert with the lowest score.\n\nInitialize `logcnt` to 1s.\nInitialize `logical_expert_scores` to `weight / logcnt`.\nCreate a min-heap where elements are `(score, logical_expert_index, layer_index)`.\n\nFor `i` from `num_log` to `num_phy - 1`:\n1.  Extract the minimum element `(score, j, l)` from the heap. This is the logical expert `j` in layer `l` with the lowest current score.\n2.  Assign the `i`-th physical expert to logical expert `j` in layer `l`.\n3.  Update `logcnt[l, j] += 1`.\n4.  Calculate the new score for logical expert `j` in layer `l`: `new_score = weight[l, j] / logcnt[l, j]`.\n5.  Push `(new_score, j, l)` back into the heap.\n\nThis heap-based approach is standard for this type of \"assign to minimize max\" problem. It should be more efficient than repeated `argmin` calls.\n\nHowever, implementing a PyTorch-native heap that works efficiently across layers is non-trivial within the current function signature. The current `replicate_experts` iterates `num_log` to `num_phy`, and inside this loop, it computes `potential_new_loads` across all logical experts for all layers. Then it finds `argmin` across `num_log` for each layer.\n\nThe current `replicate_experts` does:\n`num_redundant = num_phy - num_log` iterations.\nInside each iteration:\n    `weight / logcnt`: `[n, num_log]` division.\n    `.max(dim=-1)`: O(n * num_log).\n    `.indices`: O(n).\n    `logcnt[arangen, redundant_indices]`: `[n]` gather.\n    `logcnt += 1`: O(n).\nTotal for `replicate_experts`: O(num_redundant * n * num_log).\n\nIf we switch to `argmin`:\n`num_redundant` iterations.\nInside each iteration:\n    `weight / (logcnt + 1)`: `[n, num_log]` division.\n    `.argmin(dim=-1)`: O(n * num_log).\n    Then O(n) for assignments.\nTotal for `replicate_experts`: O(num_redundant * n * num_log).\n\nThe complexity seems similar. The difference might be in the constant factors and how the operations are optimized by PyTorch. The logical correction is more important.\n\nLet's apply the logical correction to `replicate_experts`.\n\nRegarding `balanced_packing`, the prompt also mentions \"Consider simplifying the code to improve readability and maintainability\". The current `balanced_packing` is quite dense.\nThe section finding the minimum pack:\n```python\n            available_mask = (current_pack_items < groups_per_pack)\n            available_pack_indices = torch.nonzero(available_mask).squeeze(-1)\n            weights_of_available_packs = current_pack_weights[available_pack_indices]\n            local_min_idx = torch.argmin(weights_of_available_packs).item()\n            pack = available_pack_indices[local_min_idx].item()\n```\nThis can be made more readable by extracting it into a helper function if it were more complex, but here it's already a standard pattern. The \"simplification\" might refer to making the logic clearer. The current code is reasonably clear for someone familiar with tensor operations.\n\nThe `rebalance_experts_hierarchical` function also has a lot of index manipulation and reshaping.\n`log2mlog = (((group_pack_index * groups_per_node + group_rank_in_pack) * group_size).unsqueeze(-1) + torch.arange(group_size, dtype=torch.int64, device=group_pack_index.device)).flatten(-2)`\nThis line is quite complex. It might be possible to break it down or use more descriptive variable names.\n\nLet's focus on the `replicate_experts` correction. This is a high-impact change for correctness and potentially speed.\n\n```python\n# Original Code Snippet in replicate_experts\n        redundant_indices = (weight / logcnt).max(dim=-1).indices\n        phy2log[:, i] = redundant_indices\n        rank[:, i] = logcnt[arangen, redundant_indices]\n        logcnt[arangen, redundant_indices] += 1\n```\n\nThis needs to be replaced with the logic that minimizes the *potential new load*.\n\nThe current `rebalance_experts` function has a conditional:\n```python\n    if num_groups % num_nodes == 0:\n        # use hierarchical load-balance policy\n        phy2log, phyrank, logcnt = rebalance_experts_hierarchical(\n            weight, num_replicas, num_groups, num_nodes, num_gpus)\n    else:\n        # use global load-balance policy\n        phy2log, phyrank, logcnt = rebalance_experts_hierarchical(\n            weight, num_replicas, 1, 1, num_gpus)\n```\nThe `else` branch calls `rebalance_experts_hierarchical` with `num_groups=1`, `num_nodes=1`. This essentially flattens the problem to a global balance without considering node hierarchy. This is correct.\n\nThe primary target for improvement is the `replicate_experts` function's logic.\n\nLet's consider the structure of `replicate_experts` and how to make it more efficient or correct.\nThe current implementation is O(num_redundant * n * num_log).\nIf `num_redundant` is large, this is slow.\n\nThe goal is to assign `num_phy` experts in total.\nWe have `num_log` logical experts.\nWe need to add `num_redundant = num_phy - num_log` more.\n\nThe correct greedy strategy to minimize maximum load is to always add the next replica to the logical expert that currently has the minimum load *per replica*.\n\nLet's refine the `replicate_experts` function with the correct logic.\n\n```python\ndef replicate_experts(\n        weight: torch.Tensor,\n        num_phy: int) -> tuple[torch.Tensor, torch.Tensor, torch.Tensor]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Replicate `num_log` experts to `num_phy` replicas, such that the maximum\n    load of all replicas is minimized.\n\n    Parameters:\n        weight: [X, num_log]\n        num_phy: total number of experts after replication\n\n    Returns:\n        phy2log: [X, num_phy], logical expert id of each physical expert\n        rank: [X, num_phy], the replica rank\n        logcnt: [X, num_log], number of replicas for each logical expert\n    \"\"\"\n    n, num_log = weight.shape\n    num_redundant = num_phy - num_log\n    assert num_redundant >= 0\n    device = weight.device\n\n    # Initialize mappings and counts\n    # phy2log: [n, num_phy] - maps physical expert index to logical expert index\n    # rank: [n, num_phy] - maps physical expert index to its replica rank\n    # logcnt: [n, num_log] - counts how many physical experts are assigned to each logical expert\n    phy2log = torch.empty(n, num_phy, dtype=torch.int64, device=device)\n    rank = torch.empty(n, num_phy, dtype=torch.int64, device=device)\n    logcnt = torch.ones(n, num_log, dtype=torch.int64, device=device)\n\n    # Assign the initial num_log physical experts to their respective logical experts\n    # The first num_log physical experts are assigned directly to their logical counterparts.\n    for i in range(num_log):\n        phy2log[:, i] = i\n        rank[:, i] = 0 # The first physical expert is rank 0\n\n    # We need to add num_redundant more physical experts.\n    # For each of these, we select the logical expert that currently has the minimum load per replica.\n    # This is a greedy approach to minimize the maximum load.\n\n    # Calculate the current load per replica for each logical expert.\n    # Ensure float division.\n    current_loads_per_replica = weight.float() / logcnt.float()\n\n    # We will use these current loads to decide which logical expert gets the next replica.\n    # We need to perform this selection for each layer independently.\n    \n    # For each of the remaining physical experts to assign (from num_log to num_phy-1)\n    for i in range(num_log, num_phy):\n        # For each layer, find the logical expert that has the minimum current load per replica.\n        # This is the logical expert that will receive the (i)-th physical expert.\n        \n        # The current_loads_per_replica tensor already holds the loads for the current state.\n        # We need to find the logical expert index (column index) that has the minimum value in each row (layer).\n        \n        # Find the logical expert index with the minimum load for each layer.\n        # `selected_logical_experts` will be a tensor of shape [n]\n        selected_logical_experts = torch.argmin(current_loads_per_replica, dim=-1)\n\n        # Assign the current physical expert `i` to the selected logical expert for each layer.\n        for layer_idx in range(n):\n            logical_expert_idx = selected_logical_experts[layer_idx].item()\n            \n            # Assign the physical expert `i` to the `logical_expert_idx` for `layer_idx`\n            phy2log[layer_idx, i] = logical_expert_idx\n            \n            # The rank of this new physical expert is the current count of replicas for that logical expert.\n            rank[layer_idx, i] = logcnt[layer_idx, logical_expert_idx]\n            \n            # Increment the count of replicas for that logical expert.\n            logcnt[layer_idx, logical_expert_idx] += 1\n\n            # Update the `current_loads_per_replica` for the chosen logical expert in this layer.\n            # This is crucial for the next iteration's selection.\n            # The new load for this logical expert will be weight[layer_idx, logical_expert_idx] / logcnt[layer_idx, logical_expert_idx].\n            current_loads_per_replica[layer_idx, logical_expert_idx] = weight[layer_idx, logical_expert_idx].float() / logcnt[layer_idx, logical_expert_idx].float()\n\n    return phy2log, rank, logcnt\n\n```\nThis revised `replicate_experts` function implements the correct greedy strategy. It should improve the `balancedness_score` and potentially the `speed_score` by having a more direct calculation of which logical expert to choose. The main change is using `argmin` on `current_loads_per_replica` and then updating that tensor. This avoids recalculating `weight / (logcnt + 1)` repeatedly from scratch.\n\nLet's consider the `balanced_packing` function's minimum finding again.\nThe current code:\n```python\n            available_mask = (current_pack_items < groups_per_pack)\n            available_pack_indices = torch.nonzero(available_mask).squeeze(-1)\n            weights_of_available_packs = current_pack_weights[available_pack_indices]\n            local_min_idx = torch.argmin(weights_of_available_packs).item()\n            pack = available_pack_indices[local_min_idx].item()\n```\nThis is O(num_packs) for each group.\nThe alternative is to iterate:\n```python\n            min_pack_weight = float('inf')\n            selected_pack_idx = -1\n            for p_idx in range(num_packs):\n                if current_pack_items[p_idx] < groups_per_pack:\n                    if current_pack_weights[p_idx] < min_pack_weight:\n                        min_pack_weight = current_pack_weights[p_idx]\n                        selected_pack_idx = p_idx\n            pack = selected_pack_idx\n```\nThis avoids intermediate tensors but is still O(num_packs). The original tensor-based approach might even be faster if `num_packs` is small due to optimized CUDA kernels, but it creates intermediate tensors. For CPU operations, the direct loop might be cleaner and potentially faster if `num_packs` is not excessively large.\n\nGiven the prompt's focus on improving `speed_score` and `combined_score` which are currently low, and the identification of \"Areas identified for improvement: Consider simplifying the code to improve readability and maintainability\", the correction to `replicate_experts` is the most promising. It directly addresses a potential logical flaw and changes the core computation. The `balanced_packing` optimization is more about micro-optimization.\n\nLet's stick with the `replicate_experts` correction as the primary change.\n\nFinal check on the proposed `replicate_experts` logic:\n- It correctly identifies the logical expert with the minimum current load per replica.\n- It updates the `logcnt` and the `current_loads_per_replica` tensor for the next iteration.\n- This is a standard greedy approach for minimizing the maximum.\n\nThe original code was likely aiming for a different heuristic, possibly related to distributing the *increase* in load, but minimizing the *maximum* load is generally achieved by always picking the currently least loaded.\n\nLet's prepare the diff for the `replicate_experts` function.\n\nThe changes will be within the `replicate_experts` function definition.\n\n```python\n# Original code in replicate_experts\n    for i in range(num_log, num_phy):\n        redundant_indices = (weight / logcnt).max(dim=-1).indices\n        phy2log[:, i] = redundant_indices\n        rank[:, i] = logcnt[arangen, redundant_indices]\n        logcnt[arangen, redundant_indices] += 1\n    return phy2log, rank, logcnt\n\n# New code for replicate_experts\n    # Calculate the current load per replica for each logical expert.\n    # Ensure float division.\n    current_loads_per_replica = weight.float() / logcnt.float()\n\n    # For each of the remaining physical experts to assign (from num_log to num_phy-1)\n    for i in range(num_log, num_phy):\n        # For each layer, find the logical expert that has the minimum current load per replica.\n        # This is the logical expert that will receive the (i)-th physical expert.\n        \n        # Find the logical expert index with the minimum load for each layer.\n        # `selected_logical_experts` will be a tensor of shape [n]\n        selected_logical_experts = torch.argmin(current_loads_per_replica, dim=-1)\n\n        # Assign the current physical expert `i` to the selected logical expert for each layer.\n        for layer_idx in range(n):\n            logical_expert_idx = selected_logical_experts[layer_idx].item()\n            \n            # Assign the physical expert `i` to the `logical_expert_idx` for `layer_idx`\n            phy2log[layer_idx, i] = logical_expert_idx\n            \n            # The rank of this new physical expert is the current count of replicas for that logical expert.\n            rank[layer_idx, i] = logcnt[layer_idx, logical_expert_idx]\n            \n            # Increment the count of replicas for that logical expert.\n            logcnt[layer_idx, logical_expert_idx] += 1\n\n            # Update the `current_loads_per_replica` for the chosen logical expert in this layer.\n            # This is crucial for the next iteration's selection.\n            # The new load for this logical expert will be weight[layer_idx, logical_expert_idx] / logcnt[layer_idx, logical_expert_idx].\n            current_loads_per_replica[layer_idx, logical_expert_idx] = weight[layer_idx, logical_expert_idx].float() / logcnt[layer_idx, logical_expert_idx].float()\n\n    return phy2log, rank, logcnt\n```\nThis change should improve correctness and potentially performance.\n\nOne final check: The original `replicate_experts` function uses `arangen = torch.arange(n, dtype=torch.int64, device=device)`. My new version iterates `layer_idx` from `0` to `n-1`, so `arangen` is not needed. The new version uses `selected_logical_experts` which is already `[n]`.\n\nThe prompt also mentioned: \"Metrics showing regression: speed_score, combined_score. Consider reverting or revising recent changes in these areas.\"\nThis suggests that previous attempts might have made changes that hurt speed. My proposed change aims to fix a logical issue that is likely impacting both balancedness and speed (due to inefficient computation or incorrect strategy).\n\nIf the `replicate_experts` function is indeed the bottleneck, this change should yield significant improvements.\n\n```python\n# Original replicate_experts function\ndef replicate_experts(\n        weight: torch.Tensor,\n        num_phy: int) -> tuple[torch.Tensor, torch.Tensor, torch.Tensor]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Replicate `num_log` experts to `num_phy` replicas, such that the maximum\n    load of all replicas is minimized.\n\n    Parameters:\n        weight: [X, num_log]\n        num_phy: total number of experts after replication\n\n    Returns:\n        phy2log: [X, num_phy], logical expert id of each physical expert\n        rank: [X, num_phy], the replica rank\n        logcnt: [X, num_log], number of replicas for each logical expert\n    \"\"\"\n    n, num_log = weight.shape\n    num_redundant = num_phy - num_log\n    assert num_redundant >= 0\n    device = weight.device\n    phy2log = torch.arange(num_phy, dtype=torch.int64,\n                           device=device).repeat(n, 1)\n    rank = torch.zeros(n, num_phy, dtype=torch.int64, device=device)\n    logcnt = torch.ones(n, num_log, dtype=torch.int64, device=device)\n    arangen = torch.arange(n, dtype=torch.int64, device=device)\n    for i in range(num_log, num_phy):\n        redundant_indices = (weight / logcnt).max(dim=-1).indices\n        phy2log[:, i] = redundant_indices\n        rank[:, i] = logcnt[arangen, redundant_indices]\n        logcnt[arangen, redundant_indices] += 1\n    return phy2log, rank, logcnt\n\n# Proposed revised replicate_experts function\ndef replicate_experts(\n        weight: torch.Tensor,\n        num_phy: int) -> tuple[torch.Tensor, torch.Tensor, torch.Tensor]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Replicate `num_log` experts to `num_phy` replicas, such that the maximum\n    load of all replicas is minimized.\n\n    Parameters:\n        weight: [X, num_log]\n        num_phy: total number of experts after replication\n\n    Returns:\n        phy2log: [X, num_phy], logical expert id of each physical expert\n        rank: [X, num_phy], the replica rank\n        logcnt: [X, num_log], number of replicas for each logical expert\n    \"\"\"\n    n, num_log = weight.shape\n    num_redundant = num_phy - num_log\n    assert num_redundant >= 0\n    device = weight.device\n\n    #
