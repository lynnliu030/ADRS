The goal is to improve both, with a focus on efficiency as perfect load balancing is NP-hard.\n\nUpon reviewing the code, the primary area for improvement in terms of execution speed is the handling of device placement and the presence of Python loops in performance-critical sections.\n\n**Analysis of Current Program's Performance Bottlenecks:**\n\n1.  **CPU vs. GPU Computation:** The `rebalance_experts` function explicitly moves the `weight` tensor to CPU (`weight.float().cpu()`) at the very beginning. While this might be intended to avoid GPU memory pressure for large metadata or to be consistent with the original DeepSeek EPLB implementation (which might rely on CPU-optimized operations or C++ extensions), it can significantly slow down computations if the `weight` tensor originates from a GPU and the system has powerful GPUs. PyTorch operations are generally much faster on GPU than CPU, even for small tensors, due to parallel processing capabilities. Moving data back and forth between CPU and GPU incurs overhead.\n\n2.  **Python Loop Overhead in `balanced_packing`:** The `balanced_packing` function contains nested Python `for` loops (`for i in range(num_layers):` and `for group_id in indices[i]:`). The inner loop, which iterates `num_groups` times for each layer, performs a `torch.argmin` call and subsequent tensor updates. While `torch.argmin` itself is efficient, the overhead of the Python loop and the repeated conversions between Python scalars (`.item()`) and PyTorch tensors can accumulate, especially when `num_layers` and `num_groups` are large.\n\n3.  **`balancedness_score` Regression:** The `balancedness_score` regression (0.2983 vs. 0.3528) suggests that the current algorithm's output is less balanced. This might be due to the specific greedy heuristics used, or potentially subtle differences in floating-point precision or tie-breaking when computations are forced onto the CPU. The fallback mechanism for non-divisible `num_groups` (`rebalance_experts_hierarchical(weight, num_replicas, 1, 1, num_gpus)`) might also contribute to less optimal balancing by simplifying the problem too much for certain configurations. However, fundamentally changing the greedy algorithm is outside the scope of \"improving the current algorithm\" and would likely increase complexity and execution time.\n\n**Proposed Improvements:**\n\n1.  **Prioritize GPU Computation (Speed Improvement):** Modify `rebalance_experts` to keep computations on the GPU if the input `weight` tensor is already on a CUDA device. This avoids unnecessary data transfers to CPU and leverages the GPU's computational power for tensor operations. The results will then be moved back to the original device. This is expected to be the most significant contributor to `speed_score` improvement.\n\n2.  **Micro-optimization in `balanced_packing` (Speed Improvement):** Remove the `.item()` call when the result of `torch.argmin` is used for tensor indexing (`pack_index` and `pack_weights_per_layer`). PyTorch generally allows 0-dimensional tensors (scalars) to be used directly for indexing, reducing the Python overhead of converting to a native Python integer. The `assert` statement will still need `.item()` as it's a Python-level check.\n\n3.  **Remove Outdated Comment:** Update the comment in `balanced_packing` that assumes `weight` is on CPU, as the device handling logic will make this assumption incorrect.\n\nThese changes are targeted at improving the efficiency of the existing algorithm without fundamentally altering its greedy nature or introducing complex new heuristics, thus maintaining the spirit of \"improving the algorithm to be more efficient\" while hoping to not regress `balancedness_score` further (and potentially improve it slightly if precision issues were a factor).\n\n```python\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    weight = weight.float().cpu()\n    if num_groups % num_nodes == 0:\n        # use hierarchical load-balance policy\n        phy2log, phyrank, logcnt = rebalance_experts_hierarchical(\n            weight, num_replicas, num_groups, num_nodes, num_gpus)\n    else:\n        # use global load-balance policy\n        phy2log, phyrank, logcnt = rebalance_experts_hierarchical(\n            weight, num_replicas, 1, 1, num_gpus)\n    num_redundant_experts = num_replicas -
