This suggests that recent changes might have introduced performance bottlenecks without impacting the load balancing quality.\n\nUpon review, the most critical performance bottleneck appears to be the explicit transfer of the `weight` tensor to CPU (`.cpu()`) at the entry point of `rebalance_experts`. If the `weight` tensor originates from a GPU (which is typical in a vLLM server environment), forcing all subsequent computations onto the CPU will severely degrade performance. By keeping the computations on the original device (presumably GPU), we can leverage PyTorch's optimized GPU operations.\n\nAdditionally, the `balanced_packing` function contains an explicit `device=\"cpu\"` initialization for `pack_index`, which would force this tensor to CPU even if other tensors are on GPU. This should be corrected to use the `weight.device`.\n\nFinally, a minor optimization in `balanced_packing` can be applied by replacing the `clone()` and masked assignment with `torch.where` for creating `candidate_weights`. While potentially minor, `torch.where` can sometimes be more efficient as it can be implemented as a fused operation.\n\nThese changes aim to significantly improve the `speed_score` by ensuring computations are performed on the most efficient device (GPU, if available) without altering the core load balancing heuristics, thus maintaining `balancedness_score`.\n\nHere are the proposed changes:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    weight = weight.float().cpu()\n=======\n    weight = weight.float() # Keep on original device (likely GPU)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    pack_index = torch.full_like(weight,\n                                 fill_value=-1,\n                                 dtype=torch.int64,\n                                 device=\"cpu\")\n    rank_in_pack = torch.full_like(pack_index, fill_value=-1)\n    # Initialize tensors to hold pack weights and item counts for all layers.\n    # These are on CPU because the input 'weight' is moved to CPU in rebalance_experts.\n    pack_weights_per_layer = torch.zeros(\n        num_layers, num_packs, dtype=weight.dtype, device=weight.device)\n    pack_items_per_layer = torch.zeros(\n        num_layers, num_packs, dtype=torch.int64, device=weight.device)\n=======\n    pack_index = torch.full_like(weight,\n                                 fill_value=-1,\n                                 dtype=torch.int64,\n                                 device=weight.device) # Use weight's device\n    rank_in_pack = torch.full_like(pack_index, fill_value=-1)\n    # Initialize tensors to hold pack weights and item counts for all layers.\n    # These tensors will be on the same device as 'weight' for efficient processing.\n    pack_weights_per_layer = torch.zeros(\n        num_layers, num_packs, dtype=weight.dtype, device=weight.device)\n    pack_items_per_layer = torch.zeros(\n        num_layers, num_packs, dtype=torch.int64, device=weight.device)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n            candidate_weights = current_pack_weights.clone()\n            candidate_weights[~available_mask] = float('inf')\n\n            # Use torch.argmin to find the index of the pack with the minimum weight.\n            # .item() converts the 0-dim tensor result to a Python scalar.\n            pack = torch.argmin(candidate_weights).item()\n=======\n            # Use torch.where to set unavailable pack weights to infinity for argmin.\n            # This avoids an explicit clone and subsequent masked assignment.\n            candidate_weights = torch.where(available_mask,\n                                            current_pack_weights,\n                                            torch.tensor(float('inf'), device=weight.device, dtype=current_pack_weights.dtype))\n\n            # Use torch.argmin to find the index of the pack with the minimum weight.\n            # .item() converts the 0-dim tensor result to a Python scalar.\n            pack = torch.argmin(candidate_weights).item()\n>>>>>>> REPLACE"]}}}
