Each SEARCH section must exactly match code in the current program.\nBe thoughtful about your changes and explain your reasoning thoroughly.\n\nIMPORTANT: Do not rewrite the entire program - focus on targeted improvements.\n", "responses": ["The current performance metrics show a significant regression, especially in `speed_score` (0.0299) compared to the top-performing programs (e.g., 0.1143). The `balancedness_score` also regressed.\n\nUpon reviewing the code, the primary area for improvement in terms of efficiency appears to be the `balanced_packing` function, specifically within its inner loop where experts are assigned to packs. The current implementation repeatedly creates temporary tensors (`available_pack_indices`, `weights_of_available_packs`) and calls `torch.where` inside the `num_groups` loop. This leads to high overhead from tensor allocations and computations, directly impacting the `speed_score`.\n\nThe core logic of `balanced_packing` is a greedy assignment: for each item (group), assign it to the pack with the minimum current load, provided that pack is not yet full.\n\n**Proposed Improvement:**\nThe inefficiency in `balanced_packing` can be addressed by maintaining a single temporary tensor for pack weights (`temp_argmin_weights`) that reflects the current load and marks full packs with `float('inf')`. This eliminates the need for repeated `torch.where` calls and dynamic slicing, replacing them with more efficient `O(1)` tensor updates and a single `torch.argmin` call on a fixed-size tensor in each iteration.\n\n**Detailed Change:**\nIn the `balanced_packing` function, within the loop over `num_layers`:\n1. Initialize `temp_argmin_weights` by cloning `current_pack_weights` once per layer.\n2. Inside the loop over `num_groups`:\n    a. Use `torch.argmin(temp_argmin_weights)` directly to find the best pack. This automatically handles full packs because their weights are set to `float('inf')`.\n    b. After assigning a group and updating `current_pack_weights` and `current_pack_items`, update `temp_argmin_weights` for the chosen pack.\n    c. If the chosen pack becomes full, set its corresponding weight in `temp_argmin_weights` to `float('inf')`.\n\nThis change maintains the same greedy assignment strategy, so the `balancedness_score` should be preserved or potentially improved due to cleaner logic. The significant reduction in tensor operations and Python overhead per inner loop iteration is expected to substantially improve the `speed_score`. This refactoring aligns with common optimization patterns for such problems and the observed \"32 lines with 17 lines\" change in top-performing programs.\n\n**Expected Impact:**\n- **`speed_score`**: Significant improvement due to reduced overhead from tensor creation/deletion and more efficient indexing/masking.\n- **`balancedness_score`**: Expected to remain similar or slightly improve, as the core greedy assignment logic is preserved and made more robust.\n- **`combined_score`**: Expected to improve significantly due to the combined positive effects on speed and balancedness.\n- **Readability/Maintainability**: The `float('inf')` pattern is a clear and concise way to handle conditional selection in `argmin`, simplifying the code.\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        # Create a mask for packs that are not yet full.\n        not_full_mask = current_pack_items < groups_per_pack\n        \n        # Find the indices of available packs.\n        available_pack_indices = torch.where(not_full_mask)[0]\n        \n        # If all packs are full, this should not happen given the problem constraints.\n        # Asserting this for debugging.\n        assert torch.any(not_full_mask), \"All packs are full, but we are still assigning items.\"\n\n        # Iterate through the group IDs sorted by weight.\n        for group_idx_in_sorted_list in range(num_groups):\n            # Get the actual group ID from the sorted indices.\n            group_id = layer_indices[group_idx_in_sorted_list].item()\n\n            # Get the weights corresponding to these available pack indices.\n            weights_of_available_packs = current_pack_weights[available_pack_indices]\n            \n            # Find the index within the `available_pack_indices` tensor that corresponds to the minimum weight.\n            best_available_idx = torch.argmin(weights_of_available_packs)\n            \n            # Get the actual pack index (the original index in the `num_packs` dimension).\n            pack = available_pack_indices[best_available_idx]\n\n            # Assign the group to the chosen pack.\n            # The `group_id` is the column index for the `pack_index` and `rank_in_pack` tensors.\n            pack_index[i, group_id] = pack\n            rank_in_pack[i, group_id] = current_pack_items[pack]\n\n            # Update pack weights and item counts for the chosen pack.\n            current_pack_weights[pack] += weight[i, group_id]\n            current_pack_items[pack] += 1\n\n            # After assigning an item to a pack, we need to update the `not_full_mask` and `available_pack_indices`\n            # for the next iteration.
