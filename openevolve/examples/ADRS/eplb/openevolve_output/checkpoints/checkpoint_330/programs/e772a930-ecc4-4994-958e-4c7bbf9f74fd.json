Each SEARCH section must exactly match code in the current program.\nBe thoughtful about your changes and explain your reasoning thoroughly.\n\nIMPORTANT: Do not rewrite the entire program - focus on targeted improvements.\n", "responses": ["The current performance metrics show a significant regression in both `balancedness_score` and `speed_score` compared to the top-performing programs. The current algorithm is based on DeepSeek EPLB, which employs greedy heuristics for expert rearrangement and replication. Perfect load balancing is NP-hard, so these heuristics are crucial.\n\nThe problem statement indicates two goals: 1. Improve load balancing (balancedness_score); 2. Improve efficiency (speed_score).\n\nUpon reviewing the code, especially given the context of vLLM (which typically runs on GPUs), a potential bottleneck could be the explicit transfer of the `weight` tensor to CPU (`weight.float().cpu()`) at the start of `rebalance_experts`. However, the comment within `balanced_packing` suggests that `weight` is *expected* to be on CPU. If this is an intentional design choice (e.g., due to CPU memory availability or specific workflow), then moving computations to GPU is not a valid improvement within the current framework. Assuming the CPU transfer is intentional, we focus on optimizing the CPU-bound operations and the load balancing strategy.\n\n**Analysis of Current Algorithm and Potential Bottlenecks:**\n\n1.  **`balanced_packing` function:** This function uses a greedy \"Largest Processing Time\" (LPT) heuristic for packing. It iterates through layers and then through sorted groups, finding the minimum-weight pack. The inner loop involves `torch.argmin` and tensor updates. The `temp_pack_weights = current_pack_weights.clone()` line inside the innermost loop creates a new tensor copy repeatedly, which can be an overhead.\n\n2.  **`replicate_experts` function:** This function greedily replicates experts by selecting the one with the highest *average* load. The loop iterates `num_redundant` times, performing `max().indices` and updates. This is a standard greedy approach for this problem.\n\n3.  **`rebalance_experts_hierarchical` function:** This orchestrates the packing and replication in a hierarchical manner (groups to nodes, then experts within nodes, then experts to GPUs). This hierarchy is often used to leverage faster intra-node communication, but it can impose constraints that limit the *global* load balance.\n\n4.  **`rebalance_experts` function (entry point):** It decides between a \"hierarchical\" policy (if `num_groups` is a multiple of `num_nodes`) and a \"global\" policy (by calling `rebalance_experts_hierarchical` with `num_groups=1, num_nodes=1`). The hierarchical policy is preferred when applicable.\n\n**Proposed Improvements:**\n\n1.  **Speed Improvement (Micro-optimization in `balanced_packing`):**\n    The `balanced_packing` function creates a `clone()` of `current_pack_weights` in each inner loop iteration. This can be avoided by using `masked_fill` on a temporary view or a copy, which might be more optimized or avoid redundant memory allocations.\n\n2.  **Balancedness Improvement (Policy Change in `rebalance_experts`):**\n    The current `balancedness_score` is significantly lower than previous top performers. This suggests that the hierarchical partitioning chosen when `num_groups % num_nodes == 0` might be detrimental to the overall load balance across all physical experts. While hierarchical partitioning is good for network locality, it might restrict the flexibility needed for optimal global load balancing. By always using the \"global\" strategy (i.e., treating all logical experts as one large group and all nodes as one conceptual node), the algorithm gains maximum flexibility to distribute experts and their replicas across all available physical experts/GPUs, potentially leading to a better `balancedness_score`. This comes at the potential cost of ignoring network topology, which is not directly measured by `balancedness_score`. Given the goal to improve `balancedness_score`, this policy change is a direct attempt.\n\nThese changes are targeted to improve both aspects: the `balanced_packing` change aims for a minor speedup, and the `rebalance_experts` change aims for a significant improvement in `balancedness_score`.\n\nHere are the specific changes in the requested diff format:\n\n```python\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n            temp_pack_weights = current_pack_weights.clone()\n            full_mask = (current_pack_items == groups_per_pack)\n            temp_pack_weights[full_mask] = float('inf')\n            \n            # Find the index of the pack with the minimum weight.\n            # This will always find an available pack as long as there are items left to assign.\n            pack = torch.argmin(temp_pack_weights).item()\n=======\n            full_mask = (current_pack_items == groups_per_pack)\n            # Create a temporary tensor for argmin that excludes full packs.\n            # Using masked_fill is often more efficient than clone() then assignment.\n            pack = torch.argmin(current_pack_weights.masked_fill(full_mask, float('inf'))).item()\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    if num_groups % num_nodes == 0:\n        # use hierarchical load-balance policy\n        phy2log, phyrank, logcnt = rebalance_experts_hierarchical(\n            weight, num_replicas, num_groups, num_nodes, num_gpus)\n    else:\n        # use global load-balance policy\n        phy2log, phyrank, logcnt = rebalance_experts_hierarchical(\n            weight, num_replicas, 1, 1, num_gpus)\n=======\n    # Always use the global load-balance policy by treating all experts as one group\n    # and all nodes as one conceptual node.
