The goal is to improve `balancedness_score` while maintaining or improving `speed_score`.\n\nThe core expert rearrangement logic is implemented in `balanced_packing` and `replicate_experts`. These functions employ greedy heuristics for load balancing, which are generally robust. The current implementation replaced Python's `heapq` (min-heap/max-heap) with vectorized PyTorch operations (`torch.min`, `torch.max`). While this typically improves speed, a drastic drop in `balancedness_score` suggests a subtle bug or an adverse effect of the vectorized approach's tie-breaking behavior, or potential numerical precision issues.\n\nUpon close inspection, the vectorized implementations of `balanced_packing` and `replicate_experts` correctly mimic the greedy logic of their heap-based counterparts. The advanced indexing and parallel updates across layers appear sound.\n\nHowever, the significant drop in `balancedness_score` points to a more fundamental issue than minor tie-breaking differences. One potential area for subtle issues is numerical stability, especially during divisions that determine `current_scores` in `replicate_experts`. While `weight` is cast to `float` at the entry point of `rebalance_experts`, ensuring all subsequent computations involving it maintain a consistent float type is good practice.\n\n**Proposed Change:**\n\nI will focus on the `replicate_experts` function, which is critical for distributing load among replicated experts. I will make a minor change to explicitly ensure that all tensors involved in the `current_scores` calculation (`weight` and `current_logcnt`) are explicitly cast to `torch.float32` (or the `weight.dtype` if it were `float64`) before division. This change aims to:\n\n1.  **Improve Numerical Stability/Clarity:** Explicitly casting `weight` and `current_logcnt` to `torch.float32` for the division makes the type conversion explicit and consistent. While PyTorch's automatic type promotion usually handles this, explicit casting can sometimes prevent subtle precision issues or clarify intent, especially when dealing with integer tensors (`current_logcnt`) that become part of floating-point calculations. This might resolve any obscure floating-point precision related issues that could lead to non-optimal greedy choices.\n2.  **Maintain Speed:** This change is extremely minor in terms of computational overhead and should not negatively impact `speed_score`.\n3.  **Readability/Maintainability:** It makes the intent of floating-point arithmetic clearer.\n\nThis targeted change addresses a potential area of subtle numerical instability that could degrade the quality of the greedy choices made by the algorithm, without altering the core greedy strategy or significantly impacting performance. If the drastic `balancedness_score` drop is due to these subtle issues, this change has the potential to restore it.\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    # We want to greedily pick the expert with the highest score (most load per current replica) to replicate next.\n    current_scores = weight / current_logcnt.float()\n=======\n    # We want to greedily pick the expert with the highest score (most load per current replica) to replicate next.\n    # Ensure all components are float32 for consistent and precise division.\n    current_scores = weight.to(torch.float32) / current_logcnt.to(torch.float32)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        # The new score is original_weight / new_count.\n        original_weights_chosen = weight[row_indices, best_log_indices]\n        new_counts_chosen = current_logcnt[row_indices, best_log_indices]\n        current_scores[row_indices, best_log_indices] = original_weights_chosen / new_counts_chosen.float()\n=======\n        # The new score is original_weight / new_count.\n        # Ensure all components are float32 for consistent and precise division.\n        original_weights_chosen = weight[row_indices, best_log_indices]\n        new_counts_chosen = current_logcnt[row_indices, best_log_indices]\n        current_scores[row_indices, best_log_indices] = original_weights_chosen.to(torch.float32) / new_counts_chosen.to(torch.float32)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE"]}}}
