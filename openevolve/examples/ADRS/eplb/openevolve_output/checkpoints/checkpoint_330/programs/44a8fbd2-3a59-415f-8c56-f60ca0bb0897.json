A key change observed in the current code, which was likely introduced recently, is the explicit conversion of the `weight` tensor to `float64` (`weight.double()`).\n\n**Reasoning for the proposed change:**\n\n1.  **Speed Score Regression**: Converting `weight` to `float64` significantly increases the memory bandwidth and computational cost for all subsequent floating-point operations. If the original `weight` tensor was `float32` (or `bfloat16`), this conversion doubles the data size and can slow down operations considerably. The previous top-performing programs achieved better `speed_score` without this explicit conversion, suggesting that `float32` (or the original precision) was sufficient for performance.\n\n2.  **Balancedness Score Regression**: While `float64` offers higher numerical precision, it's not guaranteed to improve the `balancedness_score` for a heuristic-based algorithm like this. In fact, the current program with `float64` shows a *lower* `balancedness_score` (0.2983) than the previous best (0.3528). This indicates that the increased precision might not be yielding better decisions, or it could even be subtly changing tie-breaking or other numerical behaviors in a way that leads to a less optimal greedy solution for the specific input distributions. If `float32` was sufficient for numerical stability in prior versions that performed better on `balancedness_score`, then reverting to it should help. For load balancing, the relative magnitudes are often more important than absolute precision to many decimal places.\n\nBy removing the `weight.double()` conversion, the algorithm will operate with the original precision of the `weight` tensor (likely `float32` or `bfloat16`). This is expected to:\n*   **Improve `speed_score`**: By reducing computational overhead and memory bandwidth requirements.\n*   **Improve `balancedness_score`**: By reverting to a precision level that was previously associated with better balancing performance, and avoiding any unforeseen negative interactions introduced by `float64`.\n\nThis change is targeted and directly addresses a likely cause of the observed performance regression in both metrics.\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    # Cast weight to float for calculations if not already, and keep on original device.\n    # Moving to CPU adds overhead if data is already on GPU and might slow down ops.\n    # Convert weight to double precision (float64) to ensure numerical stability\n    # for division and sum operations.
