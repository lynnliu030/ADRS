This suggests that the primary focus for improvement should be on execution speed.\n\nUpon reviewing the code, especially the `rebalance_experts` and `balanced_packing` functions, the most significant performance bottleneck appears to be the explicit movement of tensors to CPU and subsequent operations on the CPU, despite PyTorch being optimized for GPU execution. For vLLM, which operates on GPUs, performing calculations on the CPU introduces substantial overhead due to data transfers between host and device memory.\n\nThe `balanced_packing` function, in particular, contains nested Python loops that iterate over layers and groups. While the greedy assignment logic within these loops is inherently sequential and hard to fully vectorize, keeping all tensor operations on the GPU will greatly reduce the overhead associated with each step.\n\nMy proposed improvements focus on:\n1.  **Device Consistency:** Ensuring all tensor operations remain on the original device (presumably GPU, given the vLLM context) by removing unnecessary `.cpu()` calls and explicitly setting the device where new tensors are created. This eliminates costly host-to-device and device-to-host memory transfers.\n2.  **Micro-optimizations within loops:**\n    *   Pre-computing static tensors (like the `inf_mask_tensor` in `balanced_packing`) to avoid repeated creation inside tight loops.\n    *   Removing an `assert` statement from the innermost loop of `balanced_packing` to reduce minor overhead in production environments (though this is a small gain compared to device consistency).\n\nThese changes will preserve the core logic and thus the `balancedness_score` should remain similar, while the `speed_score` is expected to improve significantly by leveraging GPU acceleration.\n\nHere are the specific changes:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    weight = weight.float().cpu()\n=======\n    # Ensure weight is float and stays on its original device.\n    # For vLLM, it's typically on GPU.
