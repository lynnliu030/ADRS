This suggests that recent changes might have introduced computational overhead.\n\nAnalyzing the `balanced_packing` function, which is a core component and called multiple times within `rebalance_experts_hierarchical`:\n1.  **Python Loop Overhead**: The function contains nested Python `for` loops (`for i in range(num_layers):` and `for group_id in indices[i]:`). If `num_layers` (or `X` in the function signature) and `num_groups` (or `n`) are large, the overhead of these Python loops can be substantial, even if the operations inside them are vectorized PyTorch operations on small tensors. For example, `X` can be up to `num_layers * num_nodes` (e.g., 64 * 4 = 256), and `n` can be up to `num_groups` (e.g., 256). This results in `256 * 256 = 65536` inner loop iterations.\n2.  **Scalar Conversions (`.item()`)**: Inside the inner loop of `balanced_packing`, several `.item()` calls are used to convert 0-dimensional PyTorch tensors (like `local_min_idx` and `pack`) to Python scalars. While these tensors are small, repeated conversions between PyTorch tensors (which reside on the device, e.g., GPU) and Python scalars (which reside on the CPU) can introduce synchronization overhead and slow down execution, especially if the operations are primarily intended to run on the GPU. PyTorch allows using 0-dimensional tensors directly as indices, avoiding this conversion.\n\nThe `replicate_experts` function also uses a Python `for` loop, but the core computation `(weight / logcnt).max(dim=-1).indices` is fully vectorized across layers (`n` dimension), which is efficient. The `balanced_packing` function's greedy nature (assigning to the least loaded pack) makes it inherently sequential per layer, making full vectorization across `group_id` difficult without fundamentally changing the algorithm. However, the operations within each inner loop iteration can be optimized.\n\n**Proposed Improvement:**\nThe most direct and safest improvement to address potential speed issues, especially related to Python overhead and CPU-GPU synchronization, is to eliminate unnecessary `.item()` calls in `balanced_packing`. By keeping these operations entirely within the PyTorch tensor domain, we reduce the number of times control passes between Python and PyTorch's C++/CUDA backend. This is a common best practice for optimizing PyTorch code.\n\nThis change is a micro-optimization but can contribute to better `speed_score` by reducing overhead. It also slightly improves readability by making the code more consistent with PyTorch tensor operations.\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n            local_min_idx = torch.argmin(weights_of_available_packs).item()\n            \n            # Map this local index back to the global pack index.\n            pack = available_pack_indices[local_min_idx].item()\n\n            # Assert that a valid pack was found and it has space.\n            assert current_pack_items[pack] < groups_per_pack\n\n            # Assign the group to the chosen pack.\n            # `group_id` is a 0-dim tensor, which can be directly used for indexing.\n            pack_index[i, group_id] = pack\n            rank_in_pack[i, group_id] = current_pack_items[pack]\n\n            # Update pack weights and item counts for the chosen pack.\n            # `weight[i, group_id]` is the weight of the current group.\n            pack_weights_per_layer[i, pack] += weight[i, group_id]\n            pack_items_per_layer[i, pack] += 1\n=======\n            local_min_idx = torch.argmin(weights_of_available_packs)\n            \n            # Map this local index back to the global pack index.\n            pack = available_pack_indices[local_min_idx] # pack is a 0-dim tensor\n\n            # Assert that a valid pack was found and it has space.\n            # `pack` is a 0-dim tensor, which can be used directly for indexing.\n            assert current_pack_items[pack] < groups_per_pack\n\n            # Assign the group to the chosen pack.\n            # `group_id` is a 0-dim tensor, which can be directly used for indexing.\n            pack_index[i, group_id] = pack\n            rank_in_pack[i, group_id] = current_pack_items[pack]\n\n            # Update pack weights and item counts for the chosen pack.\n            # `weight[i, group_id]` is the weight of the current group.\n            pack_weights_per_layer[i, pack] += weight[i, group_id]\n            pack_items_per_layer[i, pack] += 1\n>>>>>>> REPLACE"]}}}
