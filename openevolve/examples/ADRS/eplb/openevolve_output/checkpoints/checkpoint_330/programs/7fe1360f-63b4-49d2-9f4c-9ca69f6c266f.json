The `balancedness_score` remains stable, suggesting that the core balancing logic is effective but its implementation might have introduced overhead. The goal is to improve both speed and balancedness, with a clear focus on addressing the speed regression.\n\nThe primary suspect for the `speed_score` regression is the use of Python loops combined with scalar indexing and repeated tensor operations, especially if these operations are performed on a GPU. Two main functions are involved: `balanced_packing` and `replicate_experts`.\n\n1.  **`balanced_packing` analysis:**\n    This function implements a greedy bin-packing heuristic (similar to Longest Processing Time or Best Fit Decreasing). It iterates through each layer and then through each sorted group within that layer, assigning it to the currently least loaded pack.\n    The inner loop:\n    ```python\n            for group_id in indices[i]:\n                # ... operations ...\n                pack = torch.argmin(...).item()\n                assert current_pack_items[pack] < groups_per_pack # Assert statement\n                pack_index[i, group_id] = pack\n                rank_in_pack[i, group_id] = current_pack_items[pack]\n                pack_weights_per_layer[i, pack] += weight[i, group_id]\n                pack_items_per_layer[i, pack] += 1\n    ```\n    If the tensors are on a GPU, using Python scalars (`i`, `group_id`, `pack`) for indexing and assignment can incur CPU-GPU synchronization overhead for each operation. While `torch.argmin` itself is optimized, the repeated Python loop calls and scalar indexing can add up.\n\n    **Improvement for `balanced_packing` (Minor Speed):**\n    Removing the `assert` statement can provide a small, low-risk speedup in production environments where assertions are not strictly needed for correctness validation.\n\n2.  **`replicate_experts` analysis:**\n    This function greedily replicates experts by repeatedly finding the expert with the highest average load and adding a replica for it.\n    The core loop:\n    ```python\n    for i in range(num_log, num_phy):\n        redundant_indices = (weight / logcnt).max(dim=-1).indices\n        phy2log[:, i] = redundant_indices\n        rank[:, i] = logcnt[arangen, redundant_indices]\n        logcnt[arangen, redundant_indices] += 1\n    ```\n    This loop runs `num_redundant = num_phy - num_log` times. In each iteration, it performs a division, a `max` reduction, and three advanced indexing operations. While the operations themselves are vectorized across layers (`n`), the Python loop itself can be a bottleneck if `num_redundant` is large. For example, if 64 experts need to be replicated, this loop runs 64 times.\n\n    **Improvement for `replicate_experts` (Major Speed, Potential Balancedness Trade-off):**\n    Instead of replicating one expert at a time, we can replicate a *batch* of experts in each iteration. This changes the greedy strategy from selecting the single most loaded expert to selecting the top-K most loaded experts. This might slightly alter the `balancedness_score` in some edge cases, but for a significant speedup, this trade-off is often acceptable and can lead to a better `combined_score`. `torch.topk` can be used to efficiently find the indices of the top-K experts. This reduces the number of Python loop iterations from `num_redundant` to `num_redundant / replication_batch_size`.\n\n    The `replication_batch_size` can be dynamically determined based on the problem size, for instance, a fraction of `num_log`, ensuring it's at least 1. This balances the benefit of batching with not deviating too much from the original greedy strategy.\n\n**Proposed Changes:**\n\n1.  **Remove `assert` from `balanced_packing` for minor speedup.**\n2.  **Batch replication in `replicate_experts` for significant speedup.**\n\nThese changes aim to address the identified performance bottlenecks while maintaining (or slightly adjusting for better overall score) the load balancing quality.\n\n```diff\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n            assert current_pack_items[pack] < groups_per_pack\n=======\n            # assert current_pack_items[pack] < groups_per_pack # Removed for performance\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    for i in range(num_log, num_phy):\n        redundant_indices = (weight / logcnt).max(dim=-1).indices\n        phy2log[:, i] = redundant_indices\n        rank[:, i] = logcnt[arangen, redundant_indices]\n        logcnt[arangen, redundant_indices] += 1\n=======\n    # Batch replication for speed.
