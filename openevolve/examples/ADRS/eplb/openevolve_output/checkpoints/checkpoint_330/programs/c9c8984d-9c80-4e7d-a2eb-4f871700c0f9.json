This drastic drop suggests either a core logical flaw introduced recently or a performance bottleneck that severely impacts the overall score.\n\nUpon reviewing the code, the line `weight = weight.float().cpu()` in the `rebalance_experts` function is a prime candidate for improvement concerning `speed_score`. Moving a potentially large `torch.Tensor` from GPU to CPU, performing computations, and then implicitly moving results back (if subsequent operations are used on GPU) introduces significant overhead. While the `replicate_experts` function does use Python's `heapq` module, which operates on CPU scalars (`.item()` calls), the bulk tensor operations within `balanced_packing` and other parts of the hierarchy (`torch.sort`, `scatter_`, `gather`, `view`, `expand`, etc.) are designed to run efficiently on the device the tensor resides on. By forcing the `weight` tensor to CPU at the start, we negate the potential benefits of GPU acceleration for these tensor operations.\n\nRemoving `.cpu()` will allow the `weight` tensor to remain on its original device (likely GPU if coming from vLLM) for all tensor operations. This should directly improve the `speed_score`.\n\nRegarding `balancedness_score`, while the `.cpu()` conversion primarily affects speed, it could indirectly impact balancedness if:\n1.  The original `weight` tensor had a higher precision (e.g., `float64` or `bfloat16`) and converting to `float32` on CPU introduces subtle precision errors that alter the sorting or heap priority decisions, leading to a sub-optimal expert assignment.\n2.  There's an implicit assumption or bug in the testing environment or subsequent processing steps that expects the output tensors to be on a specific device, and the `.cpu()` call somehow breaks this.\n\nThe core algorithms (`balanced_packing` with its snake pattern and `replicate_experts` with its min-heap greedy approach) are generally robust and well-established heuristics for load balancing. They should yield reasonable balancedness scores. The dramatic drop indicates a more fundamental issue. By removing the `.cpu()` conversion, we eliminate a potential source of device-related or precision-related inconsistencies that might be contributing to the `balancedness_score` regression, in addition to directly improving speed.\n\n**Proposed Change:**\n\nRemove the `.cpu()` call, keeping the `weight` tensor on its original device while ensuring it's `float` type.\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    weight = weight.float().cpu()\n=======\n    weight = weight.float() # Ensure float type, keep on original device\n>>>>>>> REPLACE"]}}}
