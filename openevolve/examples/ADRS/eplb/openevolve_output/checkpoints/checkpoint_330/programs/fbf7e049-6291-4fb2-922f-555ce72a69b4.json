This indicates that the core load-balancing logic is effective, but its execution time needs improvement. The prompt also suggests simplifying the code for readability and maintainability.\n\nUpon reviewing the code, the `balanced_packing` function appears to be the most critical area for performance optimization due to its nested Python loops and repeated tensor operations within those loops. Specifically, inside the innermost loop, the line `torch.full_like(current_pack_weights, float('inf'))` is called repeatedly for each group in each layer. While `torch.full_like` is efficient, its repeated allocation within a tight loop can accumulate overhead, especially if the tensor is small and allocated frequently.\n\n**Proposed Change:**\n\nTo improve efficiency, we can pre-allocate the tensor of infinities (`inf_mask_tensor`) once before the main loops in `balanced_packing`. This eliminates redundant memory allocations and tensor creations, leading to a small but consistent speedup for each iteration of the inner loop. This change does not alter the core greedy algorithm, thus preserving the `balancedness_score` while aiming to improve the `speed_score`. It also slightly improves readability by making the constant mask clearer.\n\n**Reasoning for the change:**\n\n1.  **Reduce Allocation Overhead:** The original code creates a new `torch.full_like` tensor of infinities in every iteration of the inner `for group_id in indices[i]` loop. By pre-allocating `inf_mask_tensor` once outside the loops, we eliminate `num_layers * num_groups` tensor allocations, which can be a significant source of overhead, particularly on CPU.\n2.  **Maintain Algorithm Correctness:** This is a micro-optimization that only affects how a constant tensor is provided to `torch.where`. The logic of finding the minimum-weight pack among available ones remains identical, ensuring the `balancedness_score` is unaffected.\n3.  **Improved Readability:** Naming the pre-allocated tensor `inf_mask_tensor` also clarifies its purpose in masking full packs.\n\nThis targeted change directly addresses a potential source of inefficiency in the most frequently executed part of the load balancer.\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    # Initialize tensors to hold pack weights and item counts for all layers.\n    # These tensors are on the same device as 'weight' (which is CPU).\n    pack_weights_per_layer = torch.zeros(\n        num_layers, num_packs, dtype=weight.dtype, device=weight.device)\n    pack_items_per_layer = torch.zeros(\n        num_layers, num_packs, dtype=torch.int64, device=weight.device)\n\n    # Iterate over each layer.
