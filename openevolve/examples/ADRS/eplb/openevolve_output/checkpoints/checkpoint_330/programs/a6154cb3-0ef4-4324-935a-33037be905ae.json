The primary goal is to address this regression.\n\nUpon reviewing the code, the most impactful optimization for `speed_score` that does not alter the core load balancing logic (and thus should not negatively impact `balancedness_score`) is related to the construction of the `logical_to_physical_map` (`log2phy` tensor).\n\n**Problem Identification:**\n\nIn the `rebalance_experts` function, the `log2phy` tensor is initialized with a size based on `maxlogcnt = num_redundant_experts + 1`. This `maxlogcnt` represents a theoretical upper bound for the number of replicas a single logical expert could have. However, in practice, the actual maximum number of replicas for any logical expert (`logcnt.max().item()`) is often much smaller due to the load balancing algorithm's distribution.\n\nInitializing `log2phy` with this overly generous `maxlogcnt` leads to:\n1.  **Increased Memory Usage**: A larger tensor consumes more memory than necessary.\n2.  **Slower `scatter_` Operation**: The `scatter_` operation, used to populate `log2phy`, becomes less efficient when operating on a larger target tensor, especially if it's mostly filled with `-1` (empty slots). This can significantly impact `speed_score`.\n\n**Proposed Improvement:**\n\nCalculate `maxlogcnt` more precisely by using the actual maximum number of replicas observed across all logical experts, which is `logcnt.max().item()`. This value is available after the `replicate_experts` call. This change will reduce the size of the `log2phy` tensor to its minimum required dimensions, leading to:\n*   Reduced memory footprint.\n*   Faster `scatter_` operation, directly improving `speed_score`.\n*   No change to the expert assignment logic, thus preserving or potentially improving `balancedness_score` by optimizing the downstream processing.\n\nThis change also contributes to the \"simplify the code to improve readability and maintainability\" goal by making the tensor sizing more accurate and transparent.\n\n**Change:**\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    num_redundant_experts = num_replicas - num_logical_experts\n    maxlogcnt = num_redundant_experts + 1\n    log2phy: torch.Tensor = torch.full(\n        (num_layers, num_logical_experts, maxlogcnt),\n        -1,\n        dtype=torch.int64,\n        device=logcnt.device,\n    )\n    log2phy.view(num_layers, -1).scatter_(\n        -1,\n        phy2log * maxlogcnt + phyrank,\n        torch.arange(num_replicas, dtype=torch.int64,\n                     device=log2phy.device).expand(num_layers, -1),\n    )\n=======\n    # Determine the actual maximum number of replicas any logical expert has.\n    # This value is derived from the 'logcnt' tensor which holds the counts\n    # for each logical expert after the replication process.\n    # Using this actual maximum instead of a theoretical upper bound reduces\n    # the size of the 'logical_to_physical_map' tensor, saving memory and\n    # improving the performance of the scatter operation.\n    actual_max_replicas = logcnt.max().item()\n    log2phy: torch.Tensor = torch.full(\n        (num_layers, num_logical_experts, actual_max_replicas),\n        -1,\n        dtype=torch.int64,\n        device=logcnt.device,\n    )\n    # The index calculation for scatter_ needs to use the same 'actual_max_replicas'\n    # as the stride for the replica dimension.\n    log2phy.view(num_layers, -1).scatter_(\n        -1,\n        phy2log * actual_max_replicas + phyrank,\n        torch.arange(num_replicas, dtype=torch.int64,\n                     device=log2phy.device).expand(num_layers, -1),\n    )\n>>>>>>> REPLACE"]}}}
