Specifically, `balancedness_score` and `speed_score` are much lower.\n\nThe core of the expert rearrangement algorithm lies in `balanced_packing` and `replicate_experts`.\n\n**Analysis of `balanced_packing`:**\nThe `balanced_packing` function is responsible for distributing weighted items (expert groups or physical experts) into a fixed number of packs. The current implementation iterates through each layer and, for each group within that layer, performs an `argmin` operation over all `num_packs`. This involves cloning a tensor and masking, leading to a time complexity of `O(num_layers * num_groups * num_packs)`. This can become a bottleneck, especially when `num_packs` (e.g., number of nodes or GPUs) is large.\n\n**Proposed Improvement for `balanced_packing`:**\nWe can significantly improve the efficiency of `balanced_packing` by replacing the linear scan (`argmin`) with a min-heap. For each layer, we initialize a min-heap with all packs, storing their current total weight. When assigning a group, we extract the pack with the minimum weight from the heap, update its weight by adding the group's weight, and if the pack is not yet full, push it back into the heap. This reduces the complexity of finding the minimum-weight pack from `O(num_packs)` to `O(log num_packs)`.\n\nThe new complexity for `balanced_packing` would be `O(num_layers * (num_groups log num_groups + num_groups log num_packs))`. This is a substantial improvement in `speed_score` for larger problem sizes. This change maintains the greedy nature of the algorithm, which is a common heuristic for bin packing and generally yields good load balancing, thus it should not negatively impact `balancedness_score` and might even slightly improve it by ensuring the truly minimum pack is always chosen efficiently.\n\n**Analysis of `replicate_experts`:**\nThe `replicate_experts` function already uses a min-heap to assign physical experts to logical experts, aiming to minimize the maximum load. This is a well-established greedy heuristic for this type of problem and is generally efficient and effective for load balancing. No immediate major improvements are identified here without changing the core objective or introducing more complex algorithms (which might compromise speed).\n\n**Proposed Change:**\nModify the `balanced_packing` function to use a min-heap for selecting the least loaded pack.\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    # Sort groups by weight in descending order.\n    # 'weight' is already float and on CPU from rebalance_experts,\n    # so no need for .float().cpu() here.\n    indices = weight.sort(-1, descending=True).indices\n\n    # Initialize pack_index and rank_in_pack.\n    # These will be fully populated, so `empty_like` is sufficient.\n    # They will be on the same device as 'weight' (i.e., CPU).\n    pack_index = torch.empty_like(weight, dtype=torch.int64)\n    rank_in_pack = torch.empty_like(pack_index)\n    \n    # Initialize tensors to hold pack weights and item counts for all layers.\n    # These tensors are on the same device as 'weight' (which is CPU).\n    pack_weights_per_layer = torch.zeros(\n        num_layers, num_packs, dtype=weight.dtype, device=weight.device)\n    pack_items_per_layer = torch.zeros(\n        num_layers, num_packs, dtype=torch.int64, device=weight.device)\n\n    # Iterate over each layer.
