This suggests that recent changes might have introduced inefficiencies or subtle behavioral changes.\n\nUpon reviewing the `balanced_packing` function, a critical inefficiency is identified: `torch.tensor(float('inf'), dtype=weight.dtype, device=weight.device)` is created inside the innermost `for group_id in indices[i]:` loop. If the `weight` tensor (and thus `pack_weights_for_selection_tmp`) resides on a GPU, creating a new tensor on the device in every iteration of a tight loop incurs substantial overhead due to repeated memory allocations and kernel launches. This can severely degrade `speed_score`.\n\nFurthermore, while `torch.argmin` is generally deterministic, repeated tensor creation on a GPU in a highly concurrent environment could, in rare cases, lead to minor timing variations that might subtly affect tie-breaking in `argmin` if multiple packs have identical minimum weights. This could potentially lead to slightly different assignments and, consequently, a degraded `balancedness_score` compared to a more stable execution.\n\nThe proposed solution addresses this by creating the `inf_val` tensor only once outside the loops, significantly reducing overhead and improving execution speed. This change aligns with best practices for PyTorch performance optimization, especially when working with GPUs.\n\nNo other major algorithmic changes are proposed as the core greedy heuristics used in `balanced_packing` (Largest-Fit Decreasing) and `replicate_experts` (iteratively replicating the most loaded expert) are standard and generally effective for load balancing, and their sequential nature within certain loops is inherent to these heuristics. The regression strongly indicates a performance bottleneck or subtle behavioral change rather than a flaw in the core greedy strategy itself.\n\n```python\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    # Pre-allocate a temporary tensor for pack selection within the layer loop.\n    # This avoids repeated memory allocations inside the inner group loop.\n    pack_weights_for_selection_tmp = torch.empty(num_packs, dtype=weight.dtype, device=weight.device)\n\n    # Iterate over each layer.
