These heuristics are generally efficient and provide good approximations for the NP-hard load balancing problem. The current `balancedness_score` is already competitive (0.2983), and the `speed_score` (0.0236) indicates it's reasonably fast, though there's a slight opportunity to improve speed based on historical performance.\n\nThe primary focus for improvement will be to reduce the execution time of the algorithm itself by optimizing tensor operations, and to slightly improve readability/maintainability, without compromising the `balancedness_score`.\n\n**Analysis of Current Implementation:**\n\n1.  **Device Handling:** The `weight` tensor is explicitly moved to CPU at the start of `rebalance_experts`. All subsequent tensor operations occur on the CPU. This is a deliberate design choice that avoids GPU transfer overhead during the balancing logic and is generally appropriate for this type of algorithm, which is often not compute-bound enough to warrant GPU acceleration for typical problem sizes.\n2.  **`balanced_packing` Function:**\n    *   It sorts items by weight (`weight.float().sort(...)`).\n    *   It then iterates through each layer and each sorted item, greedily assigning the item to the pack with the minimum current total weight, ensuring each pack receives `groups_per_pack` items.\n    *   The inner loop's `torch.where` and `torch.argmin` operations create temporary tensors (`candidate_weights`) in each iteration. While `torch.argmin` is highly optimized, the repeated creation of a full-sized temporary tensor for `candidate_weights` can introduce overhead, especially when `num_packs` is small (which is often the case for `num_nodes` or `num_gpus // num_nodes`).\n3.  **`replicate_experts` Function:** This function also uses a greedy approach, replicating the expert with the highest average load per replica. This is a sound heuristic for minimizing maximum load.\n4.  **Hierarchical Decomposition:** The `rebalance_experts_hierarchical` function breaks down the problem into logical steps (groups to nodes, then experts within nodes, then physical experts to GPUs). This decomposition helps manage complexity.\n\n**Proposed Improvements:**\n\nThe core greedy logic is effective for `balancedness_score`. To improve `speed_score` and `readability/maintainability`, we can focus on micro-optimizations within the `balanced_packing` function:\n\n1.  **Remove Redundant `.cpu()` Call:** The `weight` tensor is already moved to CPU at the beginning of `rebalance_experts`. Therefore, any operations on `weight` within `balanced_packing` will operate on CPU, and the result of `sort().indices` will also be on CPU. The `.cpu()` call is redundant.\n2.  **Optimize `argmin` Loop in `balanced_packing`:** Replace the `torch.where` and `torch.argmin` with a direct Python loop for finding the minimum weight pack. For small `num_packs` (e.g., 8, 16, 64), a direct Python loop can sometimes be faster by eliminating the overhead of creating temporary tensors and calling PyTorch functions for very small operations. This also makes the selection logic more explicit, which can improve readability. This change will not affect the `balancedness_score` as the underlying logic for selecting the least loaded available pack remains identical.\n\nThese changes are targeted, adhere to the diff format, and address the identified areas for improvement by reducing overhead and clarifying intent.\n\n```diff\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    indices = weight.float().sort(-1, descending=True).indices.cpu()\n    pack_index = torch.full_like(weight,\n                                 fill_value=-1,\n                                 dtype=torch.int64,\n                                 device=\"cpu\")\n    rank_in_pack = torch.full_like(pack_index, fill_value=-1)\n    # Initialize tensors to hold pack weights and item counts for all layers.\n    # These are on CPU because the input 'weight' is moved to CPU in rebalance_experts.\n    pack_weights_per_layer = torch.zeros(\n        num_layers, num_packs, dtype=weight.dtype, device=weight.device)\n    pack_items_per_layer = torch.zeros(\n        num_layers, num_packs, dtype=torch.int64, device=weight.device)\n\n    # Iterate over each layer.
