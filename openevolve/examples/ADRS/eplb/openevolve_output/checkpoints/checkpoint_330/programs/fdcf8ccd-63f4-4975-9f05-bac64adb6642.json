Each SEARCH section must exactly match code in the current program.\nBe thoughtful about your changes and explain your reasoning thoroughly.\n\nIMPORTANT: Do not rewrite the entire program - focus on targeted improvements.\n", "responses": ["The current program exhibits a significant regression in both `balancedness_score` and `speed_score` compared to previous top-performing versions. This suggests that recent changes might have introduced inefficiencies or subtly altered the load balancing logic, leading to suboptimal assignments.\n\nThe algorithm relies on greedy heuristics:\n1.  `balanced_packing`: Distributes weighted items into bins with fixed capacity, prioritizing the least loaded bin for the heaviest available item (a variant of the Longest Processing Time heuristic).\n2.  `replicate_experts`: Replicates the logical expert that currently has the highest average load per replica to reduce its burden.\n3.  `rebalance_experts_hierarchical`: Orchestrates these heuristics in a hierarchical manner (groups to nodes, then experts within nodes to GPUs).\n\nUpon reviewing the code, the core logic for these greedy heuristics appears to be correctly implemented using PyTorch tensor operations where possible. However, there are a few areas that could be refined for efficiency and readability, which might indirectly address the observed regressions.\n\n**Identified Areas for Improvement:**\n\n1.  **Redundant `float()` call**: In `balanced_packing`, `weight.float().sort(...)` is called. However, `weight` is already converted to `float().cpu()` at the entry point of `rebalance_experts`. This `float()` call is redundant and can be removed for minor efficiency gain and cleaner code.\n\n2.  **`balanced_packing` loop optimization**: The inner loop within `balanced_packing` iterates `num_groups` times per layer. Inside this loop, `torch.where` creates a temporary tensor (`temp_pack_weights`) in each iteration. While `torch.where` is generally efficient, repeatedly creating small tensors within a Python loop can incur overhead. A slightly different approach using `clone()` and `masked_fill_` might be considered cleaner by some, as it avoids the explicit `inf_tensor` variable and might be marginally more performant depending on PyTorch's internal optimizations for small tensors and specific CPU backends. This change doesn't alter the core greedy algorithm but refactors its implementation.\n\nThese changes aim to improve the `speed_score` by reducing minor overheads and potentially contribute to `balancedness_score` by ensuring the most efficient execution path for the balancing logic. The significant regression in `balancedness_score` is puzzling given the standard nature of the greedy algorithms used; it might indicate a subtle interaction with specific input data or a previous, more sophisticated heuristic that is now missing. Without access to the \"Unknown changes\" of the top-performing programs, optimizing the existing standard heuristics is the most direct approach.\n\n---\n\n```diff\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    # Ensure indices are on the correct device (CPU, as weight is already on CPU)\n    indices = weight.float().sort(-1, descending=True).indices\n=======\n    # Ensure indices are on the correct device (CPU, as weight is already on CPU)\n    # weight is already float() from the caller, so no need to call .float() again.\n    indices = weight.sort(-1, descending=True).indices\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    # Pre-allocate infinity tensor once for efficiency\n    inf_tensor = torch.tensor(float('inf'), dtype=torch.float32, device=\"cpu\")\n\n    for i in range(num_layers):\n        # Use tensors for pack_weights and pack_items for better performance\n        # These tensors are re-initialized for each layer, as packing is done per layer.\n        pack_weights_t = torch.zeros(num_packs, dtype=torch.float32, device=\"cpu\")\n        pack_items_t = torch.zeros(num_packs, dtype=torch.int64, device=\"cpu\")\n        \n        for group_idx in indices[i]:\n            # Create a mask for packs that still have capacity\n            available_packs_mask = (pack_items_t < groups_per_pack)\n            \n            # Temporarily set weights of full packs to infinity to exclude them from argmin.\n            # torch.where is efficient for conditional assignment.\n            temp_pack_weights = torch.where(available_packs_mask, pack_weights_t, inf_tensor)\n            \n            # Find the pack with the minimum weight among available ones.\n            # torch.argmin handles finding the index of the minimum value.\n            pack = torch.argmin(temp_pack_weights)\n            \n            # Update pack_index and rank_in_pack for the current group\n            pack_index[i, group_idx] = pack\n            rank_in_pack[i, group_idx] = pack_items_t[pack]\n            \n            # Update pack_weights and pack_items for the selected pack\n            pack_weights_t[pack] += weight[i, group_idx]\n            pack_items_t[pack] += 1\n=======\n    for i in range(num_layers):\n        # Use tensors for pack_weights and pack_items for better performance\n        # These tensors are re-initialized for each layer, as packing is done per layer.\n        pack_weights_t = torch.zeros(num_packs, dtype=torch.float32, device=\"cpu\")\n        pack_items_t = torch.zeros(num_packs, dtype=torch.int64, device=\"cpu\")\n        \n        for group_idx in indices[i]:\n            # Create a mask for packs that still have capacity\n            available_packs_mask = (pack_items_t < groups_per_pack)\n            \n            # Create a temporary copy to find the argmin without modifying pack_weights_t.\n            # Mask out full packs by setting their weights to infinity.\n            # This approach avoids the explicit 'inf_tensor' variable, potentially simplifying.\n            temp_pack_weights_for_argmin = pack_weights_t.clone()\n            temp_pack_weights_for_argmin.masked_fill_(~available_packs_mask, float('inf'))\n            \n            # Find the pack with the minimum weight among available ones.\n            pack = torch.argmin(temp_pack_weights_for_argmin)\n            \n            # Update pack_index and rank_in_pack for the current group\n            pack_index[i, group_idx] = pack\n            rank_in_pack[i, group_idx] = pack_items_t[pack]\n            \n            # Update pack_weights and pack_items for the selected pack\n            pack_weights_t[pack] += weight[i, group_idx]\n            pack_items_t[pack] += 1\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```"]}}}
