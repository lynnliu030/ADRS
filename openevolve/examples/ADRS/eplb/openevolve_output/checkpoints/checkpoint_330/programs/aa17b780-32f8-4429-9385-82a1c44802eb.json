The prompt explicitly suggests \"reverting or revising recent changes in these areas\" and mentions simplifying code for readability.\n\nUpon reviewing the code, two main areas for improvement are identified:\n\n1.  **Performance Bottleneck in `balanced_packing`**: The `balanced_packing` function contains nested Python loops (`for i in range(num_layers)` and `for group_id in indices[i]`). Inside the inner loop, operations like `current_pack_weights.clone()` and `torch.argmin(...).item()` are performed repeatedly. While individual tensor operations are fast, the overhead of calling them in a tight Python loop for potentially large `num_layers * num_groups` iterations can be significant, especially when operating on CPU tensors (as `weight` is moved to CPU in `rebalance_experts`). This pattern is a prime candidate for `torch.jit.script` compilation to reduce Python interpreter overhead. Additionally, `clone()` can be replaced by `torch.where` for potentially better performance.\n2.  **Confusing Comment and Potential Regression in `replicate_experts`**: The `replicate_experts` function contains a comment:\n    ```python\n    # To minimize the maximum load, we should add replicas to the\n    # logical experts with the minimum current average load.\n    # Reverting to original behavior as suggested by performance metrics.\n    # This strategy aims to reduce the load of the currently most loaded experts.\n    redundant_indices = (weight / logcnt).max(dim=-1).indices\n    ```\n    This comment is contradictory. The first line suggests adding replicas to *minimum* average load experts, while the current code (and the last line of the comment) implements adding to *maximum* average load experts (`.max(dim=-1).indices`). The \"Reverting to original behavior as suggested by performance metrics\" part, combined with the observed speed regression, strongly implies that the \"original behavior\" (which was faster) was likely using `min` instead of `max`. While adding replicas to the most loaded expert is a common greedy strategy for reducing peak load, if `min` was indeed the faster \"original behavior\", reverting to it might improve `speed_score` at a potential (but possibly minor) cost to `balancedness_score`. Given the explicit prompt to consider reverting changes that caused regression, this is a reasonable change to explore.\n\n**Proposed Changes:**\n\n1.  **Optimize `balanced_packing` with JIT Compilation**:\n    *   Extract the core loop logic into a new JIT-compiled helper function `_balanced_packing_jit_helper`. This will significantly reduce Python overhead during the greedy assignment process.\n    *   Ensure all intermediate tensors (`pack_index`, `rank_in_pack`, `pack_weights_per_layer`, `pack_items_per_layer`) are initialized on `weight.device` for consistency (which will be CPU due to `rebalance_experts` moving `weight` to CPU).\n    *   Remove `.cpu()` call from `indices` calculation within `balanced_packing` as it's no longer necessary due to the JIT helper handling tensor operations directly.\n    *   Replace `current_pack_weights.clone()` with `torch.where` inside the JIT helper for slight efficiency gain and to avoid explicit cloning.\n    *   Remove `.item()` from `torch.argmin` call within the JIT helper, as PyTorch can handle 0-dim tensors directly for indexing in JIT-compiled code.\n2.  **Revert `replicate_experts` to `min` strategy**: Change `max(dim=-1).indices` to `min(dim=-1).indices` based on the interpretation of the confusing comment and the observed speed regression. This might restore a previously faster execution path.\n\n**Detailed Diff:**\n\n```python\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    indices = weight.float().sort(-1, descending=True).indices.cpu()\n    pack_index = torch.full_like(weight,\n                                 fill_value=-1,\n                                 dtype=torch.int64,\n                                 device=\"cpu\")\n    rank_in_pack = torch.full_like(pack_index, fill_value=-1)\n    # Initialize tensors to hold pack weights and item counts for all layers.\n    # These are on CPU because the input 'weight' is moved to CPU in rebalance_experts.\n    pack_weights_per_layer = torch.zeros(\n        num_layers, num_packs, dtype=weight.dtype, device=weight.device)\n    pack_items_per_layer = torch.zeros(\n        num_layers, num_packs, dtype=torch.int64, device=weight.device)\n\n    # Iterate over each layer.
