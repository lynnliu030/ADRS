My analysis points to two primary areas for improvement:\n\n1.  **Performance Regression (`speed_score`):** The most critical issue identified is the explicit transfer of the `weight` tensor to CPU at the very beginning of the `rebalance_experts` function (`weight = weight.float().cpu()`). If the input `weight` tensor is originally on a GPU (which is highly probable in a vLLM environment for performance), this `cpu()` call forces all subsequent heavy tensor computations to run on the CPU. Moving data between CPU and GPU, and performing large computations on CPU when a GPU is available, can severely degrade performance. By removing this `.cpu()` call, the computations will remain on the original device (presumably GPU), leveraging its parallel processing capabilities and significantly improving execution speed. The `device` variable inside `rebalance_experts` was also captured after the `cpu()` call, making it always CPU, which is likely not intended.\n\n2.  **Code Readability and Maintainability:** The `rebalance_experts_hierarchical` function contains an `if/else` block where the `else` branch is effectively dead code. The outer `rebalance_experts` function is designed to always call `rebalance_experts_hierarchical` in a way that satisfies its `if` condition (`num_groups % num_nodes == 0`). Specifically, when a global balancing strategy is desired (i.e., `num_groups % num_nodes != 0` in the outer function), `rebalance_experts` calls `rebalance_experts_hierarchical` with `num_groups=1` and `num_nodes=1`. In this scenario, `1 % 1 == 0`, ensuring the `if` branch within `rebalance_experts_hierarchical` is always executed. Removing this dead `else` branch simplifies the code, removes misleading comments, and improves clarity, addressing the identified area for improvement. Additionally, some redundant `permute` and `contiguous` calls in the final reshaping within `rebalance_experts_hierarchical` can be simplified for cleaner code without performance impact.\n\nThese changes are targeted and aim to restore performance and improve code quality without altering the core load balancing heuristics. The greedy LPT (Longest Processing Time) and expert replication strategies are preserved, as they are standard and generally effective for load balancing, suggesting that the `balancedness_score` regression might have been a side effect of the speed regression (e.g., incomplete runs in evaluation due to timeouts) or specific test data.\n\n---\n\n```diff\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    weight = weight.float().cpu()\n    if num_groups % num_nodes == 0:\n        # use hierarchical load-balance policy\n        phy2log, phyrank, logcnt = rebalance_experts_hierarchical(\n            weight, num_replicas, num_groups, num_nodes, num_gpus)\n    else:\n        # use global load-balance policy\n        phy2log, phyrank, logcnt = rebalance_experts_hierarchical(\n            weight, num_replicas, 1, 1, num_gpus)\n    # The `rebalance_experts_hierarchical` and the global balancing logic\n    # now produce `phy2log_global`, `rank_global`, and `expert_count`.\n    # `phy2log_global`: [num_layers, num_replicas] -> maps physical expert index to logical expert ID.\n    # `rank_global`: [num_layers, num_replicas] -> maps physical expert index to its replica rank.\n    # `expert_count`: [num_layers, num_logical_experts] -> number of replicas for each logical expert.\n\n    # We need to construct `logical_to_physical_map`: [layers, num_logical_experts, X]\n    # where X is the maximum number of replicas for any logical expert.\n\n    # Store device for later use, assuming weight.float().cpu() is intentional.\n    # If weight is intended to stay on GPU, remove .cpu() call above.\n    device = weight.device \n\n    num_physical_experts_total = num_replicas # Corrected: use num_replicas for total physical experts\n=======\n    # Ensure weight is float for calculations, keep on original device.\n    # Moving to CPU for computation can severely degrade performance if\n    # the original weight is on a GPU.\n    weight = weight.float()\n    device = weight.device\n\n    if num_groups % num_nodes == 0:\n        # Use hierarchical load-balance policy.\n        phy2log, phyrank, logcnt = rebalance_experts_hierarchical(\n            weight, num_replicas, num_groups, num_nodes, num_gpus)\n    else:\n        # Use global load-balance policy.\n        # This is achieved by calling the hierarchical function with parameters\n        # that effectively make it operate globally (1 group, 1 node).\n        phy2log, phyrank, logcnt = rebalance_experts_hierarchical(\n            weight, num_replicas, 1, 1, num_gpus)\n    \n    # The rebalance_experts_hierarchical function (or its effective global mode)\n    # returns `phy2log_global`, `rank_global`, and `expert_count`.\n    # `phy2log_global`: [num_layers, num_replicas] -> maps physical expert index to logical expert ID.\n    # `rank_global`: [num_layers, num_replicas] -> maps physical expert index to its replica rank.\n    # `expert_count`: [num_layers, num_logical_experts] -> number of replicas for each logical expert.\n\n    # We need to construct `logical_to_physical_map`: [layers, num_logical_experts, X]\n    # where X is the maximum number of replicas for any logical expert.\n\n    num_physical_experts_total = num_replicas\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    if num_groups % num_nodes == 0:\n        # Hierarchical balancing: balance groups to nodes, then nodes to GPUs.\n        # Step 1: Pack groups to nodes.\n        group_size = num_logical_experts // num_groups\n        tokens_per_group_layer = weight.unflatten(-1, (num_groups, group_size)).sum(-1) # [num_layers, num_groups]\n\n        # Pack groups onto nodes.\n        # If num_groups % num_nodes != 0, we effectively want to balance all groups onto a single 'node' conceptually,\n        # and then distribute those across the actual num_nodes.\n        # Let's consider the case where num_groups is not divisible by num_nodes.\n        # The original code uses num_nodes for packing groups.
