Please clone() the tensor before performing the operation.\" This error indicates an issue with in-place modifications on tensors that share underlying memory, typically arising from using `expand()` or `view()` followed by assignments. The current performance scores of 0.0 are a direct result of this error.\n\nMy primary focus will be to fix this critical error, as the program cannot execute correctly otherwise. Once the program is runnable, we can then evaluate and further optimize `balancedness_score` and `speed_score`.\n\n**Analysis of the Error and Proposed Fixes:**\n\n1.  **Root Cause of the Error in `replicate_experts`**:\n    The line `phy2log = torch.arange(num_phy, dtype=torch.int64, device=device).expand(n, -1)` creates a `phy2log` tensor where all rows are views sharing the same underlying memory. When the loop `for i in range(num_log, num_phy)` later tries to assign values to `phy2log[:, i] = redundant_indices`, it attempts to write potentially different values into the same physical memory location (because `phy2log[0, i]` and `phy2log[1, i]` point to the same memory). This leads to the \"unsupported operation\" error.\n\n    **Proposed Fix 1**: Initialize `phy2log` to ensure each row has independent memory, even for the initial expert mappings. This can be achieved by creating an empty tensor and then using broadcasting with `unsqueeze(0)` for the initial assignment, which forces a copy.\n\n2.  **Minor Code Improvement in `balanced_packing`**:\n    The `balanced_packing` function contains duplicated lines for `current_pack_weights` and `current_pack_items`. Removing these improves readability and maintainability.\n    Additionally, the `torch.where` operation for `pack_weights_for_selection` can be slightly optimized by using `clone()` and then direct boolean indexing, which can sometimes be marginally faster by avoiding the overhead of `torch.where`'s internal tensor creation.\n\n**Detailed Plan:**\n\n1.  **Fix `replicate_experts` function**: Modify the initialization of `phy2log` to prevent shared memory issues when performing in-place assignments.\n2.  **Refine `balanced_packing` function**: Remove redundant lines and slightly optimize the calculation of `pack_weights_for_selection`.\n\nThese changes are targeted and aim to directly resolve the reported error while also improving minor aspects of code clarity and efficiency.\n\n---\n\n```diff\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    # Initialize pack_index and rank_in_pack.\n    # These will be fully populated, so `empty_like` is sufficient.\n    # They will be on the same device as 'weight' (i.e., CPU).\n    pack_index = torch.empty_like(weight, dtype=torch.int64)\n    rank_in_pack = torch.empty_like(pack_index)\n    \n    # Initialize tensors to hold pack weights and item counts for all layers.\n    # These tensors are on the same device as 'weight' (which is CPU).\n    pack_weights_per_layer = torch.zeros(\n        num_layers, num_packs, dtype=weight.dtype, device=weight.device)\n    pack_items_per_layer = torch.zeros(\n        num_layers, num_packs, dtype=torch.int64, device=weight.device)\n\n    # Iterate over each layer.
