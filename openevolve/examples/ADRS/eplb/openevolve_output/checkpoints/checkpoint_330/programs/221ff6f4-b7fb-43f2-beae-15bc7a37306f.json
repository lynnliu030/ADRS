Please clone() the tensor before performing the operation\" strongly suggests an issue with how `log2phy` is being updated. The `scatter_` operation is being used to fill `log2phy`, and if the indices used in `scatter_` are not unique for a given dimension, this error can occur. Specifically, `phy2log * maxlogcnt + phyrank` might be generating duplicate indices for the same `(layer, logical_expert)` pair. This needs to be addressed by ensuring unique assignments or by using a different approach to construct `log2phy`.\n\n2.  **Efficiency in `balanced_packing`:**\n    *   **`float('inf')` Usage:** The line `pack_weights_for_selection = torch.where(current_pack_items == groups_per_pack, float('inf'), current_pack_weights)` is a good optimization. However, `torch.where` creates a new tensor. If `current_pack_items` is guaranteed to have at least one element that is not `groups_per_pack` (which should be the case if `num_groups % num_packs == 0` and `groups_per_pack > 0`), we can directly modify `current_pack_weights` in place (or a copy of it) to set the full packs to infinity. This avoids the overhead of `torch.where`.\n    *   **Looping over `indices[i]`:** The current loop iterates through `indices[i]`, which are sorted by weight. This is the core of the greedy approach. However, accessing `weight[i, group_id]` inside this loop might not be the most efficient if `group_id` is not contiguous. It might be slightly better to pre-fetch the weights for the current layer based on the sorted `indices[i]`.\n\n3.  **Efficiency in `replicate_experts`:**\n    *   **`weight / logcnt` division:** This division is performed for every logical expert in every iteration. It might be more efficient to pre-calculate `1 / logcnt` and then perform multiplication, especially if `logcnt` is updated frequently. However, given that `logcnt` is updated sequentially, the current approach is likely acceptable. The main optimization here would be to ensure the division and subsequent `max` operation are as efficient as possible.\n    *   **`redundant_indices = (weight / logcnt).max(dim=-1).indices`:** This line correctly identifies which logical expert to replicate. The `weight` tensor here is `[n, num_log]`. The division `weight / logcnt` is element-wise. The `max(dim=-1)` finds the maximum value across the logical experts for each of the `n` rows. The `indices` then give the column index (logical expert ID) of that maximum. This looks generally efficient.\n\n4.  **Clarity and Potential Simplification:**\n    *   The `rebalance_experts_hierarchical` function has several nested calculations and tensor manipulations. While complex, breaking down some of the intermediate steps or using more descriptive variable names could improve readability. However, the current structure seems to follow the algorithm's logic quite closely.\n    *   The `inverse` function using `scatter_` is standard but could be a point of confusion.\n\n5.  **Consolidating `rebalance_experts` Logic:** The `rebalance_experts` function acts as a dispatcher. The call to `rebalance_experts_hierarchical` with `num_groups=1, num_nodes=1` is effectively a global load balancing strategy.

This avoids the overhead of `torch.where` and potentially reduces tensor creation within the inner loop.\n2.  **Readability/Minor Efficiency:** Pre-fetching `sorted_weights_layer = weight[i, indices[i]]` and then accessing `sorted_weights_layer[j]` within the inner loop might offer a slight performance improvement by making the weight access more direct and potentially better for caching, though the impact might be minimal. It also makes it clearer that we are processing the weights in sorted order.\n\n---\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    log2mlog = (((group_pack_index * groups_per_node + group_rank_in_pack) *\n                 group_size).unsqueeze(-1) +\n                torch.arange(group_size,\n                             dtype=torch.int64,\n                             device=group_pack_index.device)).flatten(-2)\n    mlog2log = inverse(log2mlog)\n\n    # Step 2: construct redundant experts within nodes\n    # [num_layers * num_nodes, num_logical_experts // num_nodes]\n    tokens_per_mlog = weight.gather(-1, mlog2log).view(\n        -1, num_logical_experts // num_nodes)\n    phy2mlog, phyrank, mlogcnt = replicate_experts(\n        tokens_per_mlog, num_physical_experts // num_nodes)\n\n    # Step 3: pack physical_experts to GPUs\n    # [num_layers * num_nodes, num_physical_experts // num_nodes]\n    tokens_per_phy = (tokens_per_mlog / mlogcnt).gather(-1, phy2mlog)\n    pack_index, rank_in_pack = balanced_packing(tokens_per_phy,\n                                                num_gpus // num_nodes)\n    phy2pphy = pack_index * phy_experts_per_gpu + rank_in_pack\n    pphy2phy = inverse(phy2pphy)\n\n    pphy2mlog = phy2mlog.gather(\n        -1, pphy2phy)  # [num_layers * num_nodes, num_log_per_nodes]\n    pphy2mlog = (pphy2mlog.view(num_layers, num_nodes, -1) + torch.arange(\n        0,\n        num_logical_experts,\n        num_logical_experts // num_nodes,\n        device=group_pack_index.device,\n    ).view(1, -1, 1)).flatten(-2)\n    pphy2log = mlog2log.gather(-1, pphy2mlog)\n    pphyrank = phyrank.gather(-1, pphy2phy).view(num_layers, -1)\n    logcnt = mlogcnt.view(num_layers, -1).gather(-1, log2mlog)\n    return pphy2log, pphyrank, logcnt\n\n\ndef rebalance_experts(\n    weight: torch.Tensor,\n    num_replicas: int,\n    num_groups: int,\n    num_nodes: int,\n    num_gpus: int,\n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Entry point for expert-parallelism load balancer.\n\n    Parameters:\n        weight: [layers, num_logical_experts], the load statistics for all\n            logical experts\n        num_replicas: number of physical experts, must be a multiple of\n            `num_gpus`\n        num_groups: number of expert groups\n        num_nodes: number of server nodes, where the intra-node network\n            (e.g, NVLink) is faster\n        num_gpus: number of GPUs, must be a multiple of `num_nodes`\n\n    Returns:\n        physical_to_logical_map: [layers, num_replicas], the expert index of\n            each replica\n        logical_to_physical_map: [layers, num_logical_experts, X], the replica\n            indices for each expert\n        expert_count: [layers, num_logical_experts], number of physical\n            replicas for each logical expert\n    \"\"\"\n    num_layers, num_logical_experts = weight.shape\n    # Cast weight to float for calculations if not already, and keep on original device.\n    # Moving to CPU adds overhead if data is already on GPU and might slow down ops.\n    weight = weight.float()\n    \n    if num_groups % num_nodes == 0:\n        # use hierarchical load-balance policy\n        phy2log, phyrank, logcnt = rebalance_experts_hierarchical(\n            weight, num_replicas, num_groups, num_nodes, num_gpus)\n    else:\n        # use global load-balance policy\n        phy2log, phyrank, logcnt = rebalance_experts_hierarchical(\n            weight, num_replicas, 1, 1, num_gpus)\n    num_redundant_experts = num_replicas -

The original `scatter_` operation:\n`log2phy.view(num_layers, -1).scatter_(-1, phy2log * maxlogcnt + phyrank, torch.arange(num_replicas, dtype=torch.int64, device=log2phy.device).expand(num_layers, -1))`\ncan lead to the \"more than one element refers to a single memory location\" error if the indices `phy2log * maxlogcnt + phyrank` are not unique for a given `(layer, flattened_index)` pair. This can happen if multiple physical experts map to the same logical expert with the same rank.\n\nThe fix involves replacing the `scatter_` operation with an explicit loop and dictionary-based mapping:\n1.  A new tensor `log2phy_new` is initialized.\n2.  The code iterates through each layer.\n3.  For each layer, it builds a `logical_expert_map` where keys are logical expert IDs and values are lists of `(rank, physical_expert_idx)` tuples.\n4.  It then iterates through this map, sorts the assignments by rank, and populates `log2phy_new` at the correct `[layer, log_idx, rank_val]` position with the `p_idx`.\n\nThis approach guarantees that each `(layer, log_idx, rank_val)` slot is written to at most once with the correct physical expert index, thus avoiding the `scatter_` error. While this introduces a Python loop, it's often necessary for correctness when direct vectorized operations are prone to index collisions. The performance impact should be minimal if the number of layers is not extremely large, and correctness is paramount.\n\nI've also added a comment about a potential issue in the global load balance policy call, but decided not to change it to avoid altering the core logic without further analysis. The primary focus was the scatter error."]}}}
