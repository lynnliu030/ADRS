Each SEARCH section must exactly match code in the current program.\nBe thoughtful about your changes and explain your reasoning thoroughly.\n\nIMPORTANT: Do not rewrite the entire program - focus on targeted improvements.\n", "responses": ["The current program exhibits a critical runtime error (`name 'rank' is not defined`) and shows 0.0000 for all performance metrics, indicating it's not functioning correctly. My primary focus will be to fix this error and then improve efficiency by vectorizing operations that currently rely on Python loops.\n\nThe current implementation of the `rebalance_experts` function has several issues:\n1.  **`name 'rank' is not defined` error**: In the `rebalance_experts` function, the results from `rebalance_experts_hierarchical` are unpacked into `phy2log`, `phyrank`, and `logcnt`. However, later in the same function, the variable `rank` is used (e.g., `flat_rank = rank.flatten()`) without `phyrank` being assigned to `rank`.\n2.  **Redundant `return` statement**: The `rebalance_experts` function has two `return` statements at the end, which is a syntax error or makes the second one unreachable.\n3.  **Incorrect device handling**: The `weight = weight.float().cpu()` line in `rebalance_experts` forces the `weight` tensor to CPU. Subsequent tensor creations (e.g., `torch.full(..., device=device)`) would then create tensors on CPU, even if the original `weight` was on a GPU. This can lead to performance degradation or incorrect behavior if GPU operations are expected. The `rebalance_experts_hierarchical` function correctly determines the device internally, so moving `weight` to CPU prematurely is problematic.\n4.  **Duplicated code**: The `balanced_packing` function has a duplicated `if groups_per_pack == 1:` block. While not a performance bottleneck, it's a code quality issue.\n5.  **Inefficient `expert_count` aggregation**: In the `else` (global balancing) branch of `rebalance_experts_hierarchical`, the `expert_count` aggregation uses a Python `for` loop combined with `index_add_`. This can be vectorized using `scatter_add_` for better performance, similar to how it's done in the hierarchical branch.\n6.  **Redundant `logical_to_physical_map` construction**: The `rebalance_experts_hierarchical` function (specifically its `else` branch) redundantly constructs `logical_to_physical_map` using nested Python loops. This map is already correctly and efficiently constructed in the outer `rebalance_experts` function using vectorized operations. The `rebalance_experts_hierarchical` function should only return the `physical_to_logical_map`, `rank_map`, and `expert_count`.\n\nThese proposed changes will fix the critical error, ensure correct device usage, eliminate redundant computations, and vectorize key operations, leading to improved reliability and speed. The balancedness score should also benefit from the removal of potential data handling inconsistencies.\n\nHere are the specific changes:\n\n### Change 1: Fix `rebalance_experts` - Address `rank` definition, device handling, and redundant return.\nThis consolidates multiple fixes into one diff for clarity. It ensures `weight` stays on its original device, renames `phyrank` to `rank` for consistency, and removes the duplicate `return` statement.\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    weight = weight.float().cpu()\n    if num_groups % num_nodes == 0:\n        #
