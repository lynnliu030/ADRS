Each SEARCH section must exactly match code in the current program.\nBe thoughtful about your changes and explain your reasoning thoroughly.\n\nIMPORTANT: Do not rewrite the entire program - focus on targeted improvements.\n", "responses": ["The current performance metrics show a significant regression in `speed_score` and `combined_score`, while `balancedness_score` has remained stable. This indicates that recent changes might have introduced performance bottlenecks without improving load balancing. The primary goal is to improve efficiency (speed) while maintaining or improving load balancing.\n\nThe core algorithms, `balanced_packing` and `replicate_experts`, employ greedy heuristics that are generally effective for load balancing. `balanced_packing` uses a Largest Processing Time (LPT) like heuristic, and `replicate_experts` prioritizes replicating the most heavily loaded experts to reduce their average load. These are reasonable choices for balancing load. Therefore, the focus will be on optimizing the execution speed of these existing heuristics rather than fundamentally changing the load balancing strategy, as drastic algorithmic changes would likely impact speed negatively.\n\nUpon reviewing the code, two specific micro-optimizations in `balanced_packing` can improve execution speed:\n\n1.  **Redundant `weight.float()` call**: In `balanced_packing`, the line `indices = weight.float().sort(-1, descending=True).indices` converts `weight` to float again. However, the `rebalance_experts` function already ensures that `weight` is a float tensor by calling `weight = weight.float()` at its entry point. This redundant conversion creates a temporary copy of the tensor, adding unnecessary overhead. Removing this redundant call will save computation and memory allocation.\n\n2.  **Repeated `torch.tensor(float('inf'))` creation**: Inside the inner loop of `balanced_packing`, `torch.tensor(float('inf'), device=weight.device, dtype=current_pack_weights.dtype)` is created in every iteration (`num_layers * num_groups` times). While small, repeatedly allocating and initializing this tensor can add up. Pre-allocating this `inf_val_tensor` once before the loops will eliminate this overhead.\n\nThese changes are targeted at improving the `speed_score` without negatively impacting the `balancedness_score`, as they do not alter the algorithmic logic but rather optimize its implementation. They also contribute marginally to code readability by removing a redundant operation.\n\n---\n\n```diff\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    # weight is already on CPU from rebalance_experts, so .cpu() is redundant.\n    indices = weight.float().sort(-1, descending=True).indices\n    pack_index = torch.full_like(weight,\n                                 fill_value=-1,\n                                 dtype=torch.int64,\n                                 device=weight.device) # Use weight's device\n    rank_in_pack = torch.full_like(pack_index, fill_value=-1)\n    # Initialize tensors to hold pack weights and item counts for all layers.\n    # These tensors will be on the same device as 'weight' for efficient processing.\n    pack_weights_per_layer = torch.zeros(\n        num_layers, num_packs, dtype=weight.dtype, device=weight.device)\n    pack_items_per_layer = torch.zeros(\n        num_layers, num_packs, dtype=torch.int64, device=weight.device)\n\n    # Iterate over each layer.
