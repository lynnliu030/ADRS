The goal is to improve both `balancedness_score` and `speed_score`. The previous attempts show that improvements in `balancedness_score` have often come at the cost of `speed_score`.\n\nThe current implementation of `rebalance_experts` calls `rebalance_experts_hierarchical` if `num_groups % num_nodes == 0`, otherwise it calls `rebalance_experts_hierarchical` with `num_groups=1`, `num_nodes=1`. This suggests that the hierarchical approach is generally preferred when applicable.\n\nLet's analyze the `rebalance_experts_hierarchical` function for potential optimizations and improvements in balancedness.\n\n**Observations and Potential Improvements:**\n\n1.  **`balanced_packing` function:**\n    *   The core of the load balancing is `balanced_packing`. The current implementation uses a greedy approach by sorting groups by weight and assigning them to the pack with the minimum current weight. This is a standard heuristic for the multiway number partitioning problem, which is NP-hard.\n    *   The inner loop iterates `for group_id in indices[i]:`. Inside this loop, `torch.argmin(pack_weights_for_selection)` is called. This operation can be computationally expensive if `num_packs` is large.\n    *   The creation of `pack_weights_for_selection` inside the inner loop is also a potential area for optimization.\n\n2.  **`replicate_experts` function:**\n    *   This function replicates experts to minimize the maximum load. It iterates `for i in range(num_log, num_phy):` and in each iteration, it computes `(weight / logcnt).max(dim=-1).indices`. This `max` operation is performed `num_redundant` times.\n\n3.  **Hierarchical Structure:**\n    *   The hierarchical approach aims to leverage faster intra-node communication. The logic for packing groups to nodes, then constructing redundant experts within nodes, and finally packing physical experts to GPUs seems sound. However, the specific implementation details of how weights are aggregated and passed between these stages might be improvable.\n\n**Proposed Changes:**\n\nI will focus on optimizing the `balanced_packing` function as it's a critical component affecting both balancedness and speed. I will also look at potential simplifications in `rebalance_experts_hierarchical` if possible without compromising the hierarchical strategy.\n\n**Change 1: Optimize `balanced_packing` by pre-sorting and a more efficient assignment.**\n\nThe current `balanced_packing` sorts all groups for each layer and then iterates through them. Inside the loop, it finds the minimum weight pack. We can potentially improve this by pre-calculating the target number of items per pack and then using a more direct assignment strategy.\n\nInstead of iterating through each group and finding the best pack, we can determine how many items from the sorted list should go into each pack.\n\nLet's reconsider the `balanced_packing` function. The goal is to partition `num_groups` into `num_packs` such that each pack has `groups_per_pack` items and weights are balanced.\n\nCurrent approach:\nFor each layer `i`:\n  Sort groups by weight `indices[i]`.\n  For each `group_id` in `indices[i]`:\n    Find the `pack` with the minimum `pack_weights_per_layer[i, pack]`.\n    Assign `group_id` to `pack`.\n    Update `pack_weights_per_layer[i, pack]` and `pack_items_per_layer[i, pack]`.\n\nAlternative approach for `balanced_packing`:\nFor each layer `i`:\n  Sort groups by weight `indices[i]`.\n  Iterate through `indices[i]`. For the first `groups_per_pack` items, assign them to pack 0. For the next `groups_per_pack` items, assign them to pack 1, and so on. This ensures each pack gets `groups_per_pack` items. The sorting by weight ensures that the heaviest items are distributed across packs first.\n\nThis alternative approach is simpler and likely faster, as it avoids repeated `torch.argmin`. It's a common strategy for balanced partitioning when the number of items per bin is fixed.\n\nLet's trace the current `balanced_packing` logic to confirm its behavior and then propose the alternative.\nThe current `balanced_packing` aims to assign `num_groups` items into `num_packs` bins, where each bin should ideally have `num_groups / num_packs` items. It does this greedily.\nThe issue is that `pack_weights_for_selection` is created inside the inner loop, which means for *each* group, we are re-evaluating which pack is best. This is inefficient.\n\nA more efficient way to achieve a similar greedy assignment:\n1.  Sort the weights for each layer.\n2.  Iterate through the sorted weights.\n3.  Maintain a list of current pack loads.\n4.  For each weight, assign it to the pack with the minimum current load.\n5.  Track the rank within the pack.\n\nThe current code already does this, but the `pack_weights_for_selection` creation is redundant. The `torch.where` logic is to prevent selecting packs that are already full.\n\nLet's refine the `balanced_packing` for efficiency. We can directly manage the pack assignments and loads without creating a temporary `pack_weights_for_selection` in each inner loop iteration.\n\nThe current code:\n```python\n            # Create a temporary tensor for pack weights, setting full packs to infinity\n            # for selection by torch.argmin. This avoids modifying the actual\n            # cumulative weights stored in pack_weights_per_layer.\n            pack_weights_for_selection = torch.where(\n                pack_items_per_layer[i] == groups_per_pack,\n                torch.full_like(pack_weights_per_layer[i], float('inf')),\n                pack_weights_per_layer[i]\n            )\n\n            # Find the pack with the minimum current weight (among available ones).\n            pack = torch.argmin(pack_weights_for_selection) # pack is a 0-dim tensor\n```\nThis part is inefficient. We can maintain the `pack_weights_per_layer` and `pack_items_per_layer` and directly find the best pack. The `torch.where` logic is correct for preventing full packs.\n\nConsider the structure of `indices[i]`. It's a 1D tensor of group IDs sorted by weight. The assignment should distribute these groups.\n\nLet's try to simplify the assignment logic within `balanced_packing`. Instead of iterating through `group_id` and finding the minimum pack, we can iterate through the packs and assign `groups_per_pack` items to each.\n\n**Revised `balanced_packing` strategy:**\n\nFor each layer `i`:\n1.  Get the sorted indices `indices[i]` and sorted weights `sorted_weights[i]`.\n2.  Initialize `pack_index[i, :]` and `rank_in_pack[i, :]` to zero.\n3.  Initialize `pack_weights_per_layer[i, :]` and `pack_items_per_layer[i, :]` to zero.\n4.  Iterate through `p` from 0 to `num_packs - 1`:\n    *   Identify the `groups_per_pack` items that should go into pack `p`. These are the next `groups_per_pack` items from the sorted list that haven't been assigned yet.\n    *   A simpler greedy approach: Iterate through the sorted `indices[i]`. For each `group_id`, find the pack `pack` where `pack_items_per_layer[i, pack]` is minimum. This is what the current code does but inefficiently.\n\nThe original code's intent is to assign each group to the least loaded pack. The inefficiency is in recalculating `pack_weights_for_selection` repeatedly.\n\nLet's try to optimize the selection of the minimum weight pack. Instead of `torch.where` and `torch.argmin` on a potentially large tensor, we can use a min-heap or a similar structure if performance is critical, but for typical `num_packs` sizes, the current approach might be acceptable if implemented efficiently.\n\nThe current implementation of `balanced_packing` iterates through `num_layers` and then through `num_groups` (which is sorted). For each group, it finds the best pack.\n\nLet's look at the provided \"Top Performing Programs\" and \"Inspiration Programs\". They don't show significant code changes, suggesting that the core logic of the `balanced_packing` and `replicate_experts` might be sound, but subtle implementation details or parameter choices matter.\n\nThe regression in `speed_score` and `combined_score` suggests that recent changes, while potentially improving `balancedness_score`, have hurt performance. The `balancedness_score` hasn't changed across attempts 1, 2, and 3. This implies that the core balancing mechanism itself wasn't significantly altered in terms of its *outcome* for balancedness, but rather the *process* changed, impacting speed.\n\nThe current `rebalance_experts` function has a conditional call to `rebalance_experts_hierarchical`.\nIf `num_groups % num_nodes == 0`:\n  `rebalance_experts_hierarchical(weight, num_replicas, num_groups, num_nodes, num_gpus)`\nElse:\n  `rebalance_experts_hierarchical(weight, num_replicas, 1, 1, num_gpus)`\n\nThis means the hierarchical logic is only truly active when `num_groups` is a multiple of `num_nodes`. When it's not, it falls back to a global (non-hierarchical) balancing, but it still uses the `rebalance_experts_hierarchical` function with `num_groups=1, num_nodes=1`. This seems like a logical fallback.\n\nLet's focus on the `balanced_packing` function within `rebalance_experts_hierarchical`.\n\nThe line:\n`pack_weights_for_selection = torch.where(pack_items_per_layer[i] == groups_per_pack, torch.full_like(pack_weights_per_layer[i], float('inf')), pack_weights_per_layer[i])`\nThis creates a new tensor in every iteration of the inner loop over `group_id`. This is highly inefficient.\n\n**Proposed Optimization for `balanced_packing`:**\n\nWe can maintain the `pack_weights_per_layer` and `pack_items_per_layer` and directly find the best pack. The key is to efficiently find the pack that is not full and has the minimum weight.\n\nInstead of re-creating `pack_weights_for_selection` every time, we can find the available packs and then pick the minimum among them.\n\nConsider the state for layer `i`: `pack_weights_per_layer[i]` and `pack_items_per_layer[i]`.\nWe need to find `pack` such that `pack_items_per_layer[i, pack] < groups_per_pack` and `pack_weights_per_layer[i, pack]` is minimized.\n\nA more efficient way to select the pack:\n1.  Identify packs that are not full: `available_packs_mask = pack_items_per_layer[i] < groups_per_pack`.\n2.  If `available_packs_mask.all()` is false (meaning some packs are full), we need to consider only available packs.\n3.  We can get the weights of available packs: `available_pack_weights = pack_weights_per_layer[i][available_packs_mask]`.\n4.  Find the index *within* the available packs: `min_idx_in_available = torch.argmin(available_pack_weights)`.\n5.  Map this back to the original pack index: This can be done by finding the index of the `min_idx_in_available`-th `True` value in `available_packs_mask`. This is still complex.\n\nA simpler approach:\nKeep track of the best pack for each layer.\n\nLet's revisit the core logic. The goal is to distribute `num_groups` items into `num_packs` bins, `groups_per_pack` items per bin, balancing weights.\n\nThe current code iterates through the sorted items (`indices[i]`) and for each item, it finds the best pack. This is a valid greedy strategy. The performance bottleneck is the repeated creation and `argmin` on `pack_weights_for_selection`.\n\nConsider the total number of assignments: `num_layers * num_groups`. For each assignment, we do an `argmin` over `num_packs`.\n\nIf we can optimize the `argmin` selection, we can improve speed.\n\n**Optimization Strategy:**\nInstead of creating a temporary tensor and using `torch.where`, we can directly find the minimum among available packs.\n\nLet's refine the inner loop of `balanced_packing` for layer `i`:\n\n```python\n        # For each layer, process groups in sorted order of their weights.\n        # `indices[i]` is a 1D tensor of group IDs for the current layer.\n        for group_id_tensor in indices[i]: # group_id_tensor is a 0-dim tensor\n            group_id = group_id_tensor.item() # Get the actual group ID\n\n            # Find the pack with the minimum current weight among those that are not full.\n            # Efficiently find the best pack:\n            # 1. Get weights of packs that are not full.\n            # 2. Find the minimum among these.\n            \n            # Create a mask for packs that are not yet full.\n            not_full_mask = pack_items_per_layer[i] < groups_per_pack\n            \n            # If all packs are full, this should not happen given the problem constraints.\n            # Asserting this for debugging.\n            assert torch.any(not_full_mask), \"All packs are full, but we are still assigning items.\"\n\n            # Get the weights of the non-full packs.\n            available_pack_weights = pack_weights_per_layer[i][not_full_mask]\n            \n            # Find the index of the minimum weight pack *within the available packs*.\n            min_idx_in_available = torch.argmin(available_pack_weights)\n            \n            # Now, we need to find the original index of this minimum pack.\n            # This can be done by finding the index of the `min_idx_in_available`-th True in `not_full_mask`.\n            # A more direct way to get the pack index:\n            # We can iterate through `not_full_mask` or use `torch.where` to get indices of True values,\n            # and then select the `min_idx_in_available`-th one.\n            \n            # Let's find the actual pack index more directly.\n            # This is still O(num_packs) if not optimized.\n            # A potentially faster way if num_packs is large is to use a priority queue.\n            # However, for typical numbers of packs, direct search might be fine.\n\n            # A cleaner way to find the index of the minimum of available packs:\n            # Find the indices of available packs.\n            available_pack_indices = torch.where(not_full_mask)[0]\n            \n            # Get the weights corresponding to these available pack indices.\n            weights_of_available_packs = pack_weights_per_layer[i][available_pack_indices]\n            \n            # Find the index within the `available_pack_indices` tensor.\n            best_available_idx = torch.argmin(weights_of_available_packs)\n            \n            # Get the actual pack index.\n            pack = available_pack_indices[best_available_idx]\n\n            # Assign the group to the chosen pack.\n            pack_index[i, group_id] = pack\n            rank_in_pack[i, group_id] = pack_items_per_layer[i, pack]\n\n            # Update pack weights and item counts for the chosen pack.\n            pack_weights_per_layer[i, pack] += weight[i, group_id]\n            pack_items_per_layer[i, pack] += 1\n```\nThis refined logic is conceptually the same as the original but avoids the `torch.where` and `torch.full_like` creation within the loop, which is the primary performance bottleneck. The `torch.where(not_full_mask)[0]` to get `available_pack_indices` is still an operation, but it's likely more efficient than creating a whole new tensor with `inf`.\n\n**Let's implement this optimization in `balanced_packing`.**\n\nThe current `indices[i]` is a tensor of group IDs. The `group_id` should be used as an index into the `weight` tensor. The current code `pack_index[i, group_id] = pack` assumes `group_id` is a valid column index. However, `indices[i]` contains the sorted group IDs. So, `weight[i, group_id]` is correct.\n\nThe original code uses `group_id` directly:\n`pack_index[i, group_id] = pack` where `group_id` is from `indices[i]`. This means `group_id` is actually the *value* of the group ID, not its position in the sorted list. This is correct.\n\nThe problem is the efficiency of finding `pack`.\n\nLet's try to rewrite the inner loop of `balanced_packing` to be more efficient.\n\n```python\n    # Iterate over each layer. The greedy assignment per layer is sequential.\n    for i in range(num_layers):\n        # For each layer, process groups in sorted order of their weights.\n        # `indices[i]` is a 1D tensor of group IDs for the current layer, sorted by weight.\n        layer_indices = indices[i]\n        \n        # Get the current pack loads and counts for this layer.\n        current_pack_weights = pack_weights_per_layer[i]\n        current_pack_items = pack_items_per_layer[i]\n\n        # Iterate through the group IDs sorted by weight.\n        for group_idx_in_sorted_list in range(num_groups):\n            # Get the actual group ID from the sorted indices.\n            group_id = layer_indices[group_idx_in_sorted_list].item()\n\n            # Find the pack with the minimum current weight among those that are not full.\n            # Create a mask for packs that are not yet full.\n            not_full_mask = current_pack_items < groups_per_pack\n            \n            # Find the indices of available packs.\n            available_pack_indices = torch.where(not_full_mask)[0]\n            \n            # Get the weights corresponding to these available pack indices.\n            weights_of_available_packs = current_pack_weights[available_pack_indices]\n            \n            # Find the index within the `available_pack_indices` tensor that corresponds to the minimum weight.\n            best_available_idx = torch.argmin(weights_of_available_packs)\n            \n            # Get the actual pack index (the original index in the `num_packs` dimension).\n            pack = available_pack_indices[best_available_idx]\n\n            # Assign the group to the chosen pack.\n            # The `group_id` is the column index for the `pack_index` and `rank_in_pack` tensors.\n            pack_index[i, group_id] = pack\n            rank_in_pack[i, group_id] = current_pack_items[pack]\n\n            # Update pack weights and item counts for the chosen pack.\n            current_pack_weights[pack] += weight[i, group_id]\n            current_pack_items[pack] += 1\n```\nThis revised loop structure for `balanced_packing` is more explicit and avoids the repeated tensor creation.\n\nLet's consider the `replicate_experts` function.\nThe loop `for i in range(num_log, num_phy)` runs `num_phy - num_log` times. Inside the loop, `(weight / logcnt).max(dim=-1).indices` is computed. This computes a max over `num_log` elements.\n\nThe current `replicate_experts` implementation is:\n```python\n    for i in range(num_log, num_phy):\n        redundant_indices = (weight / logcnt).max(dim=-1).indices\n        phy2log[:, i] = redundant_indices\n        rank[:, i] = logcnt[arangen, redundant_indices]\n        logcnt[arangen, redundant_indices] += 1\n```\nThis is a greedy approach. For each new physical expert slot, it picks the logical expert that, after division by its current replica count, has the maximum load. This is a standard greedy algorithm for load balancing/replication.\n\nThe performance issue might be in how `arangen` and `redundant_indices` are used.\n`logcnt[arangen, redundant_indices]` uses `arangen` which is `[0, 1, ..., n-1]`. So for each `i` (new physical expert), it correctly updates the replica count for the selected logical experts across all layers.\n\nThe `(weight / logcnt)` division and `max(dim=-1)` is the core of the greedy choice. This operation takes `O(n * num_log)` time. This is done `num_phy - num_log` times. Total time for this loop is roughly `O((num_phy - num_log) * n * num_log)`.\n\nCan we optimize this selection?\nIf `num_phy - num_log` is large, this can be slow.\nWe are essentially trying to pick the \"best\" logical expert `num_phy - num_log` times, where \"best\" is defined by `weight / logcnt`.\n\nWe can potentially optimize the selection by using a data structure that allows efficient retrieval of the maximum. For example, a max-heap of logical experts, where the priority is `weight / logcnt`. However, the `logcnt` changes, so the priorities need updating.\n\nA common strategy for this type of problem (assigning items to bins to minimize max load, or replicating to balance) is to use a min-heap for the bins (or logical experts in this case), storing their current load. When an item (or a replication slot) needs to be assigned, we extract the min from the heap, assign the item, update its load, and re-insert it.\n\nIn `replicate_experts`:\nWe have `num_log` logical experts. We need to create `num_phy - num_log` additional replicas.\nFor each layer `l` from `0` to `n-1`:\n  Logical experts: `0, 1, ..., num_log-1`.\n  Current replica counts: `logcnt[l, :]`.\n  Weights: `weight[l, :]`.\n  We want to assign `num_phy / n` replicas to each layer `l` in total, distributed among logical experts.\n\nThe current code treats each layer independently for the selection within `replicate_experts` via `max(dim=-1).indices`.\n`redundant_indices = (weight / logcnt).max(dim=-1).indices`\nThis means for each new physical expert slot `i`, it finds the `best_logical_expert_for_this_layer` for *each layer independently*. This is what we want.\n\nThe issue is the efficiency of `max(dim=-1)`.\n\nIf `num_log` is large, `max(dim=-1)` is costly.\n\nLet's consider the structure of the `replicate_experts` again.\nIt's essentially assigning `num_phy - num_log` \"slots\" to logical experts, prioritizing those with the highest `weight / logcnt`.\n\nIf we want to improve the speed of `replicate_experts`, we could consider using a priority queue (min-heap) for each layer to keep track of the logical experts and their current \"load per replica\".\n\nFor each layer `i`:\n  Maintain a min-heap of `(current_load, logical_expert_id, replica_count)`.\n  Initially, for each logical expert `j`: heap.push(`(weight[i, j], j, 1)`).\n  For `k` from `0` to `num_phy / n - 1` (number of replicas to add per layer):\n    Pop the `(load, log_id, count)` with the minimum `load`.\n    Assign the `k`-th replica for layer `i` to `log_id`.\n    Update its replica count: `new_count = count + 1`.\n    Push `(weight[i, log_id] / new_count, log_id, new_count)` back to the heap.\n\nThis would replace the `max(dim=-1)` operation with heap operations.\nHeap push/pop is `O(log num_log)`. Doing this `num_phy / n` times per layer.\nTotal for `replicate_experts`: `O(n * (num_log + (num_phy - num_log) * log num_log))`.\nThis could be faster if `num_log` is large.\n\nHowever, the current code's `max(dim=-1)` approach is simpler to implement and might be faster for smaller `num_log`. Given the regression in `speed_score`, it's possible that the overhead of the heap operations (Python-level loops, object creation) outweighs the theoretical complexity gain.\n\nLet's stick to optimizing `balanced_packing` first, as that's where the most obvious inefficiency lies.\n\n**Proposed Change 1: Optimize `balanced_packing` inner loop.**\n\nThe change will focus on making the selection of the best pack more efficient by avoiding repeated tensor creation.\n\n```python\n# Original code:\n    # Iterate over each layer.

This is computationally expensive, especially when `num_layers` and `num_groups` are large. The new code avoids this repeated tensor creation by directly managing the `not_full_mask` and `available_pack_indices`. It finds the indices of available packs, gets their weights, and then finds the minimum among them. This significantly reduces memory allocation and computation within the innermost loop, which should improve the `speed_score`.\n\nThe core greedy logic of assigning the current heaviest unassigned group to the least loaded pack remains the same, aiming to preserve or improve the `balancedness_score`. The update of `not_full_mask` and `available_pack_indices` after each assignment ensures that we always select from packs that have capacity. The recomputation of `available_pack_indices` after an assignment might still be a bottleneck if a pack becomes full, but it's a step towards a more efficient selection process.\n\n**Further Considerations (if the above change is insufficient):**\n\n*   **`replicate_experts` optimization:** If the `balanced_packing` optimization doesn't yield sufficient speed improvements, the next target would be `replicate_experts`, potentially by using a min-heap per layer to manage logical expert loads for faster selection.\n*   **Data Locality:** Ensure that tensor operations are as cache-friendly as possible. The current code operates on CPU tensors, which might be a factor. If the data were frequently on GPU, moving it to CPU just for these operations could add overhead. However, the `weight.float()` cast suggests it might be intended for CPU.\n*   **Algorithm Choice:** While greedy algorithms are heuristics for NP-hard problems, exploring alternative packing strategies (e.g., more sophisticated bin packing algorithms or approximations) could potentially improve balancedness, but might also increase complexity and execution time. The current approach seems to be a good balance.\n\nThe provided performance scores show a stable `balancedness_score` across attempts, suggesting the core balancing logic is sound. The decline in `speed_score` points to implementation inefficiencies. The proposed change directly addresses a significant inefficiency in `balanced_packing`.\n\nOne subtle point in the revised `balanced_packing` loop:\nThe line `group_id = layer_indices[group_idx_in_sorted_list].item()` correctly gets the group ID.\nThe update `pack_index[i, group_id] = pack` and `rank_in_pack[i, group_id] = current_pack_items[pack]` are correct.\nThe update to `current_pack_weights` and `current_pack_items` is also correct.\nThe recomputation of `available_pack_indices` is necessary to ensure that if the pack `pack` just became full, it's no longer considered in the next iteration of the inner loop. This is handled by re-evaluating `not_full_mask` and `available_pack_indices`.\n\nThis change specifically targets the inefficiency of creating `pack_weights_for_selection` in each inner loop iteration.\n\nThe original code has `for group_id in indices[i]:`. My proposed code has `for group_idx_in_sorted_list in range(num_groups): group_id = layer_indices[group_idx_in_sorted_list].item()`. This is semantically equivalent, but the latter makes it clearer that we are iterating through the sorted list.\n\nThe main point of improvement is replacing the `torch.where` + `torch.full_like` + `torch.argmin` on a temporary tensor with finding available packs and then finding the minimum among them.\n\nThe update logic for `available_pack_indices` after assigning an item to a pack is critical:\n```python\n            # After assigning an item to a pack, we need to update the `not_full_mask` and `available_pack_indices`\n            # for the next iteration. This is crucial for correctness.\n            # If the pack that was just filled becomes full, we need to remove it from consideration.\n            if current_pack_items[pack] == groups_per_pack:\n                # Recompute available_pack_indices for the next iteration.\n                not_full_mask = current_pack_items < groups_per_pack\n                available_pack_indices = torch.where(not_full_mask)[0]\n```\nThis part ensures that the selection of the best pack in the next iteration correctly considers the updated state of pack fullness. While `torch.where` on `not_full_mask` is still an operation, it's likely more efficient than the previous approach.\n\n\nFinal check on the code structure:\nThe `balanced_packing` function is called within `rebalance_experts_hierarchical`.\nThe changes are localized to the inner loop of `balanced_packing`.\nThe rest of the code remains untouched.\nThe change directly addresses the identified performance bottleneck.\n\nOne small simplification: The `current_pack_weights` and `current_pack_items` are just views into `pack_weights_per_layer[i]` and `pack_items_per_layer[i]`. We can directly use `pack_weights_per_layer[i]` and `pack_items_per_layer[i]` without creating these intermediate variables, although it doesn't affect performance.\n\nLet's ensure the variable names are clear and the logic is sound.\n`layer_indices = indices[i]` - this is correct.\n`group_id = layer_indices[group_idx_in_sorted_list].item()` - this is correct.\n`pack_index[i, group_id] = pack` - correct assignment.\n`rank_in_pack[i, group_id] = current_pack_items[pack]` - correct rank assignment.\n`current_pack_weights[pack] += weight[i, group_id]` - correct weight update.\n`current_pack_items[pack] += 1` - correct item count update.\n\nThe recomputation of `available_pack_indices` is the main potential remaining inefficiency in the loop. However, it's a necessary step to maintain correctness. If `num_packs` is very large, this could still be slow. But given the context, this is a significant improvement over the original.\n\nThe problem states \"improve the algorithm to be more efficient, i.e. reduce the execution time of the algorithm itself\". This change directly targets that.\n\"Improve the algorithm to achieve better load balancing\" - the greedy strategy is maintained, so balancedness should be comparable.\n\nThe change seems solid.\n\n```python\n# Original code:\n    # Iterate over each layer.

By avoiding the creation of `pack_weights_for_selection` and instead efficiently finding the best available pack, we expect to see an improvement in `speed_score` without negatively impacting `balancedness_score`. The logic for selecting the least loaded, non-full pack remains, which is a standard greedy approach for this type of partitioning problem. The update to `available_pack_indices` after a pack becomes full is crucial for correctness and ensures that the algorithm continues to select from valid packs.\n\nFinal check on the prompt: \"improve the algorithm to achieve better load balancing; while improve the algorithm to be more efficient\". The change focuses on efficiency. The balancedness is maintained by the greedy strategy. The previous attempts show that the balancedness score has been stable at 0.2983, suggesting the core strategy is effective for balancing. The regressions in speed suggest that the implementation details were the primary issue.\n\n\nOne final subtle point: the original loop `for group_id in indices[i]:` iterates over the *values* of the group IDs (which are already sorted by weight). My proposed loop `for group_idx_in_sorted_list in range(num_groups): group_id = layer_indices[group_idx_in_sorted_list].item()` iterates through the *positions* in the sorted `layer_indices` and then retrieves the actual `group_id`. This is semantically equivalent but more explicit about processing the sorted order. This is a good change.\n\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    # Iterate over each layer.
