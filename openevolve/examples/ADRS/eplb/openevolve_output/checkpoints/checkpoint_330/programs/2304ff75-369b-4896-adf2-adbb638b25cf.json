The primary area for optimization lies in the `rebalance_experts_hierarchical` function, particularly within the `balanced_packing` and `replicate_experts` helper functions.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the proposed changes:\n\n### Improvement 1: Optimizing `balanced_packing` for Speed and Balancedness\n\nThe `balanced_packing` function uses a greedy approach. While effective, the inner loop iterating `k` from `0` to `num_groups` can be computationally intensive, especially for large `num_groups`. We can optimize this by vectorizing the assignment process more aggressively and potentially using a more direct method for finding the least loaded packs.\n\nThe current masking approach `torch.where(pack_items_per_layer == groups_per_pack, float('inf'), pack_weights_per_layer)` is good, but we can explore if there's a way to avoid explicitly creating `float('inf')` by using `torch.nan_to_num` or by directly manipulating indices.\n\nAlso, the `torch.argmin` operation is performed for each layer in each iteration. We can try to optimize this by pre-sorting or using a more efficient data structure if the number of packs is large. However, given that `num_packs` is typically `num_nodes` or `num_gpus // num_nodes`, this might be less of a bottleneck.\n\nThe current code seems to iterate through `k` from `0` to `num_groups`. Each iteration selects the `k`-th heaviest group for each layer and assigns it to the least loaded pack. A potential optimization is to directly assign the top `groups_per_pack` items to each pack, which might be more efficient if implemented correctly.\n\nLet's focus on a specific optimization within `balanced_packing`: instead of iterating `k` from `0` to `num_groups`, we can try to directly assign items to packs in a more vectorized manner.\n\nCurrent logic:\nFor each layer, sort all groups by weight. Then, for each rank `k` (from heaviest to lightest), assign the group at rank `k` to the least loaded pack.\n\nAlternative:\nFor each pack, identify the `groups_per_pack` heaviest groups across all layers that haven't been assigned yet and assign them to this pack. This might involve a more complex selection process but could lead to better load balancing and potentially faster execution if vectorized well.\n\nHowever, a simpler and more direct optimization within the existing loop structure is to optimize the selection of the least loaded pack and the update step.\n\nOne specific area for improvement is how `pack_weights_per_layer` and `pack_items_per_layer` are updated. The current update `pack_weights_per_layer[layer_indices, chosen_packs] += weights_to_assign` is already quite vectorized.\n\nLet's reconsider the structure of `balanced_packing`. The core task is to assign `num_groups` items (for each layer) into `num_packs` bins, with `groups_per_pack` items per bin, minimizing the sum of squared weights (or maximizing balancedness). The current greedy approach sorts all items and then assigns them sequentially.\n\nA more direct approach to achieve balanced packing might involve sorting all `num_layers * num_groups` items together and then distributing them. However, this loses the layer-wise balancing.\n\nLet's focus on making the current loop more efficient. The bottleneck is likely the repeated `argmin` and updates.\n\nConsider the `replicate_experts` function. The loop `for i in range(num_log, num_phy):` iterates `num_redundant` times. Inside this loop, `(weight / logcnt).max(dim=-1).indices` is computed. This is a critical operation.\n\n### Improvement 2: Simplifying `rebalance_experts_hierarchical` for Readability and Efficiency\n\nThe `rebalance_experts_hierarchical` function involves several steps of reshaping, gathering, and inverse permutation. While functional, it can be made more readable and potentially more efficient by streamlining these operations.\n\nThe `inverse` helper function is a good candidate for optimization. The current implementation uses `scatter_` which is generally efficient.\n\nThe transformation from `phy2log` to `log2phy` involves complex indexing. Let's analyze if this can be simplified.\n\nThe current code splits the problem into packing groups to nodes, then replicating experts within nodes, and then packing physical experts to GPUs. This hierarchical approach is sound.\n\nLet's focus on a specific optimization in `rebalance_experts_hierarchical`: The computation of `log2mlog` and `mlog2log` involves complex indexing.\n\nThe line:\n`log2mlog = (((group_pack_index * groups_per_node + group_rank_in_pack) * group_size).unsqueeze(-1) + torch.arange(group_size, dtype=torch.int64, device=group_pack_index.device)).flatten(-2)`\nThis line is quite dense. Let's try to break it down or find a more direct way to map logical experts to their positions within the node-packed structure.\n\nSimilarly, the subsequent indexing operations can be scrutinized for potential inefficiencies.\n\nGiven the history, the previous attempts (1, 2, 3) showed improvements. The current program's metrics are regressed. This suggests that recent changes might have introduced inefficiencies or suboptimal choices.\n\nThe prompt mentions \"Consider simplifying the code to improve readability and maintainability\" and \"Metrics showing regression: balancedness_score, speed_score, combined_score. Consider reverting or revising recent changes in these areas.\"\n\nThis implies that the current implementation might be more complex than necessary, or that the specific algorithmic choices made in recent versions have negatively impacted performance.\n\nLet's target a specific area that seems complex and could be simplified: the mapping between different levels of experts (logical, node-packed, physical).\n\n### Proposed Changes:\n\n1.  **Optimize `replicate_experts` for speed:** The repeated calculation of `(weight / logcnt).max(dim=-1).indices` inside the loop for creating redundant experts is a potential bottleneck. We can explore if a more efficient way to find the expert with the minimum average load exists, possibly by pre-sorting or using a priority queue-like structure if the number of redundant experts is large. However, given the context of vLLM, `num_redundant_experts` is usually small. A more direct optimization might be to ensure that `weight` and `logcnt` are on the same device and have compatible dtypes. The current code already handles this implicitly by using `weight.device`.\n\n2.  **Simplify `rebalance_experts_hierarchical`:** The mapping logic, especially `log2mlog` and `pphy2mlog`, can be made more explicit and possibly more efficient. The `inverse` function is used multiple times. While `scatter_` is generally efficient, repeated use can add up.\n\nLet's focus on the `replicate_experts` function first, as it's a core part of the \"replication\" aspect of MoE EPLB. The current implementation iteratively adds replicas.\n\nThe core of `replicate_experts` is assigning the next replica to the logical expert that currently has the minimum load *per replica*.\n\n```python\n    for i in range(num_log, num_phy):\n        # Find the logical expert that, when a new replica is added,\n        # will have the smallest average load.\n        # This is equivalent to finding the logical expert with the minimum current load per replica.\n        redundant_indices = (weight / logcnt).max(dim=-1).indices\n        phy2log[:, i] = redundant_indices\n        rank[:, i] = logcnt[arangen, redundant_indices]\n        logcnt[arangen, redundant_indices] += 1\n```\n\nThe expression `weight / logcnt` calculates the current load per replica for each logical expert. Then `.max(dim=-1)` finds the *maximum* of these values across logical experts. This is incorrect for finding the *least loaded* expert. It should be `.min(dim=-1)`.\n\nLet's verify the objective of `replicate_experts`. It aims to \"replicate `num_log` experts to `num_phy` replicas, such that the maximum load of all replicas is minimized.\" This is a min-max problem. The greedy strategy of assigning the next replica to the currently least loaded logical expert (when considering the load *per replica*) is a common heuristic for this.\n\nThe current code uses `.max(dim=-1).indices`. This means it's finding the logical expert that *already has the highest load per replica* and assigning the new replica to it. This is counter-intuitive for load balancing. It should be finding the logical expert with the *minimum* load per replica.\n\nLet's correct this in `replicate_experts`.\n\n```python\n# Original code snippet in replicate_experts\nredundant_indices = (weight / logcnt).max(dim=-1).indices\n```\n\nThis should be:\n```python\n# Corrected code snippet in replicate_experts\n# Find the logical expert with the minimum load per replica.\n# The load per replica is weight / logcnt.\n# We want to find the minimum of this ratio.\nredundant_indices = (weight / logcnt).min(dim=-1).indices\n```\n\nThis change directly addresses the objective of minimizing the maximum load by greedily assigning replicas to the least loaded logical experts. This should improve the `balancedness_score`.\n\nNow, let's consider the `balanced_packing` function. The current implementation is a greedy approach. The prompt mentioned that \"Metrics showing regression: balancedness_score, speed_score, combined_score. Consider reverting or revising recent changes\". This suggests that the current `balanced_packing` might be a recent change that introduced issues.\n\nThe `balanced_packing` function aims to pack `n` weighted objects into `m` packs, with `n/m` objects per pack, minimizing weight imbalance. The current vectorized greedy approach is generally good. The core loop `for k in range(num_groups):` iterates `num_groups` times.\n\nLet's examine the masking and `argmin` part:\n```python\n        current_pack_weights_masked = torch.where(\n            pack_items_per_layer == groups_per_pack,\n            float('inf'),  # Set full packs to infinity\n            pack_weights_per_layer\n        )\n        chosen_packs = torch.argmin(current_pack_weights_masked, dim=1)\n```\nThis part selects the least loaded pack, ensuring not to assign to already full packs. This is correct. The efficiency comes from `torch.where` and `torch.argmin` being vectorized over `num_layers`.\n\nThe update:\n```python\n        pack_weights_per_layer[layer_indices, chosen_packs] += weights_to_assign\n        pack_items_per_layer[layer_indices, chosen_packs] += 1\n```\nThis is also vectorized. The main cost is the loop over `k`.\n\nIf the regression is due to `balanced_packing`, it might be subtle. Perhaps the way `weight` is handled, or the initial sorting. The comment \"weight is already float and on CPU from rebalance_experts\" is important. If `rebalance_experts` is called with GPU tensors, this assumption might be violated. However, the `rebalance_experts` function itself doesn't explicitly move `weight` to CPU anymore.\n\nLet's consider an alternative to the greedy assignment in `balanced_packing`. For a fixed number of items per bin, a common approach is to sort all items and then distribute them cyclically. However, this doesn't account for the \"least loaded pack\" heuristic.\n\nGiven the regression, and the goal of improving both balancedness and speed, the most direct and impactful change seems to be the correction in `replicate_experts`.\n\nFor `balanced_packing`, if the regression is due to recent changes, it's hard to pinpoint without knowing what those changes were. However, the current implementation of `balanced_packing` is a standard greedy approach. One potential area for speedup, if `num_groups` is very large, could be to use a more advanced bin packing algorithm, but that would likely increase complexity.\n\nLet's stick to the most evident bug correction first.\n\n**Proposed Change 1: Correct `replicate_experts` logic.**\nThe current logic in `replicate_experts` uses `.max(dim=-1).indices` when it should be `.min(dim=-1).indices` to find the least loaded logical expert for assigning a new replica. This is a direct fix for the load balancing objective.\n\n```python\n# Current code in replicate_experts\n        redundant_indices = (weight / logcnt).max(dim=-1).indices\n```\n\nThis should be changed to:\n```python\n# Proposed change in replicate_experts\n        # Find the logical expert with the minimum load per replica.\n        # The load per replica is weight / logcnt.\n        # We want to find the minimum of this ratio.\n        redundant_indices = (weight / logcnt).min(dim=-1).indices\n```\n\nThis change should improve `balancedness_score` and potentially `combined_score`. For `speed_score`, it might have a minor impact as it replaces `max` with `min`, which are computationally similar.\n\nLet's consider if there's any other obvious simplification or speedup.\n\nThe `rebalance_experts_hierarchical` function has a conditional call:\n```python\n    if num_groups % num_nodes == 0:\n        # use hierarchical load-balance policy\n        phy2log, phyrank, logcnt = rebalance_experts_hierarchical(\n            weight, num_replicas, num_groups, num_nodes, num_gpus)\n    else:\n        # use global load-balance policy\n        phy2log, phyrank, logcnt = rebalance_experts_hierarchical(\n            weight, num_replicas, 1, 1, num_gpus)\n```\nThis logic seems to call `rebalance_experts_hierarchical` twice with different parameters. The second call with `num_groups=1, num_nodes=1` effectively flattens the hierarchy and performs a global rebalancing. This is a reasonable fallback.\n\nThe `balanced_packing` function has a special case:\n```python\n    if groups_per_pack == 1:\n        # If each group is a pack, assignment is straightforward.\n        pack_index = torch.arange(num_groups,\n                                  dtype=torch.int64,\n                                  device=weight.device).expand(num_layers, -1)\n        rank_in_pack = torch.zeros_like(weight, dtype=torch.int64)\n        return pack_index, rank_in_pack\n```\nThis is efficient.\n\nThe sorting step `indices = weight.sort(-1, descending=True).indices` is done for all layers. This is necessary for the greedy approach.\n\nLet's analyze the `replicate_experts` function again. The division `weight / logcnt` is performed in each iteration. If `logcnt` becomes large, this division could be a bottleneck. However, `logcnt` is the count of replicas, which usually doesn't exceed a few.\n\nConsider the `rebalance_experts_hierarchical` function's complex indexing.\nThe line:\n`pphy2mlog = phy2mlog.gather(-1, pphy2phy).view(num_layers, num_nodes, -1) + torch.arange(0, num_logical_experts, num_logical_experts // num_nodes, device=group_pack_index.device).view(1, -1, 1)).flatten(-2)`\n\nThis line is calculating the logical expert index for each physical expert after packing to GPUs.\n`phy2mlog`: [num_layers * num_nodes, num_logical_experts // num_nodes]\n`pphy2phy`: [num_layers * num_nodes, num_physical_experts // num_nodes]\n\nThe `gather` operation `phy2mlog.gather(-1, pphy2phy)` selects the logical expert ID from `phy2mlog` based on the `pphy2phy` indices. The result is `[num_layers * num_nodes, num_physical_experts // num_nodes]`.\n\nThen `.view(num_layers, num_nodes, -1)` reshapes it to `[num_layers, num_nodes, num_logical_experts // num_nodes]`. This is grouping by node.\n\nThe addition `+ torch.arange(0, num_logical_experts, num_logical_experts // num_nodes, device=group_pack_index.device).view(1, -1, 1)` is key. It adds an offset to map the logical experts within each node-group to their global logical expert IDs. The offset is calculated as `[0, G, 2G, ..., (N-1)G]` where `G = num_logical_experts // num_nodes` and `N = num_nodes`. This seems correct.\n\nThe final `.flatten(-2)` flattens the last two dimensions, resulting in `[num_layers, num_physical_experts // num_nodes * num_nodes]`, which is `[num_layers, num_physical_experts]`. This is `pphy2mlog` which is supposed to be the logical expert index for each physical expert *within its node*.\n\nLet's re-read the comment for `pphy2mlog`:\n`# [num_layers * num_nodes, num_logical_experts // num_nodes]`\nThis comment seems to be for `phy2mlog` before the view. After the view and addition, it becomes `[num_layers, num_physical_experts]`.\n\nThe goal is to get `pphy2log`, which is `[num_layers, num_physical_experts]`.\nThe calculation `pphy2mlog = mlog2log.gather(-1, pphy2mlog)` seems to be mapping from the node-local logical expert index to the global logical expert index.\n\nThe line `log2mlog = (((group_pack_index * groups_per_node + group_rank_in_pack) * group_size).unsqueeze(-1) + torch.arange(group_size, dtype=torch.int64, device=group_pack_index.device)).flatten(-2)` maps logical experts to their position within a node's packing.\n\nLet's rethink the structure of `rebalance_experts_hierarchical`.\nThe overall goal is to map `phy_experts` to `log_experts`.\n\nThe current approach:\n1.  Pack logical experts into nodes based on token counts.\n    *   `tokens_per_group = weight.unflatten(-1, (num_groups, group_size)).sum(-1)`: Calculate load per group.\n    *   `group_pack_index, group_rank_in_pack = balanced_packing(tokens_per_group, num_nodes)`: Pack groups into nodes.\n    *   `log2mlog = ...`: Map logical experts to their position within a node.\n    *   `mlog2log = inverse(log2mlog)`: Map node-local logical expert index back to global logical expert index.\n\n2.  Replicate experts within nodes.\n    *   `tokens_per_mlog = weight.gather(-1, mlog2log).view(-1, num_logical_experts // num_nodes)`: Load of logical experts *after* packing into nodes. This is `[num_layers * num_nodes, num_groups_per_node * group_size]`.\n    *   `phy2mlog, phyrank, mlogcnt = replicate_experts(tokens_per_mlog, num_physical_experts // num_nodes)`: Replicate experts *within each node's group of logical experts*. `phy2mlog` is now `[num_layers * num_nodes, num_phy_per_gpu]`.\n\n3.  Pack physical experts to GPUs.\n    *   `tokens_per_phy = (tokens_per_mlog / mlogcnt).gather(-1, phy2mlog)`: Calculate load per physical expert *after* replication within nodes.\n    *   `pack_index, rank_in_pack = balanced_packing(tokens_per_phy, num_gpus // num_nodes)`: Pack these physical experts (from each node) onto GPUs.\n    *   `phy2pphy = pack_index * phy_experts_per_gpu + rank_in_pack`: Map physical experts to their final GPU position.\n    *   `pphy2phy = inverse(phy2pphy)`: Inverse mapping.\n\n    *   `pphy2mlog = phy2mlog.gather(-1, pphy2phy)`: Get the node-local logical expert index for each physical expert on a GPU.\n    *   The complex line: `pphy2mlog = (pphy2mlog.view(num_layers, num_nodes, -1) + torch.arange(0, num_logical_experts, num_logical_experts // num_nodes, device=group_pack_index.device).view(1, -1, 1)).flatten(-2)` maps these node-local logical experts to global logical experts.\n    *   `pphy2log = mlog2log.gather(-1, pphy2mlog)`: This final gather uses the `mlog2log` (which maps node-local logical expert index to global logical expert index) to get the global logical expert ID for each physical expert.\n\nThe logic seems to be sound for a hierarchical approach. The primary concern for speed and balancedness is the correctness of `replicate_experts` and the efficiency of `balanced_packing`.\n\nLet's focus on the `replicate_experts` fix, as it's a clear bug.\n\nFor speed improvements, consider the `balanced_packing` function. The current loop `for k in range(num_groups)` is the main driver of computation. If `num_groups` is large, this can be slow.\nCan we avoid sorting all `num_groups` items for each layer?\nPerhaps we can use a selection algorithm (like `kth_element`) to find the `groups_per_pack` heaviest items for each pack without a full sort. However, `torch.sort` is highly optimized.\n\nA possible speedup in `balanced_packing` could be to optimize the initialization of `pack_weights_per_layer` and `pack_items_per_layer`. They are initialized to zeros.\n\nLet's consider the prompt again: \"improve the algorithm to achieve better load balancing; while ... improve the algorithm to be more efficient\".\n\nThe fix in `replicate_experts` addresses balancedness. For speed, the `balanced_packing` function is the main candidate.\n\nOne way to potentially speed up `balanced_packing` is to use `torch.topk` instead of sorting if we only need a subset of the sorted elements. However, the current loop assigns items one by one greedily, which requires knowing the relative order of all items.\n\nPerhaps the issue is in how `weight` is handled. The comment \"weight is already float and on CPU from rebalance_experts\" is misleading if `rebalance_experts` is called with GPU tensors. The line `if weight.dtype != torch.float: weight = weight.float()` is good, but it doesn't enforce CPU. If `weight` is on GPU, `torch.sort` and other operations will run on GPU, which is usually faster.\n\nLet's consider the possibility that the regression is due to a change in how `balanced_packing` is called or how its inputs are prepared.\n\nIf we want to improve *both* balancedness and speed, and given the regression, the `replicate_experts` fix is crucial for balancedness. For speed, let's look at `balanced_packing` again.\n\nThe loop iterates `num_groups` times. Inside, it finds the `k`-th heaviest group for each layer and assigns it.\nConsider the case where `num_groups` is large. The sorting step `weight.sort(-1, descending=True)` is `O(num_groups * log(num_groups))`. The loop runs `num_groups` times, and inside, `argmin` is `O(num_packs)`. Total for the loop is `O(num_groups * num_packs)`.\n\nIf `num_groups` is much larger than `num_packs`, the `num_groups * num_packs` term dominates.\n\nWhat if we pre-calculate the \"target\" load for each pack and try to fill them?\nThis sounds like a variation of the multiway number partitioning problem, which is NP-hard. The greedy approach is a heuristic.\n\nLet's look at the `Inspiration 1` program, which had a \"Modification: Change 1: Replace 32 lines with 17 lines\" and improved scores. This suggests that simplification and reduction in code complexity can lead to better performance.\n\nThe current `balanced_packing` function has ~60 lines. The `replicate_experts` has ~20 lines. `rebalance_experts_hierarchical` has ~60 lines. `rebalance_experts` has ~40 lines.\n\nThe most complex part might be the re-indexing and mapping in `rebalance_experts_hierarchical`.\n\nLet's consider the `balanced_packing` implementation. The core idea is to greedily assign the heaviest remaining items to the least loaded bins. The current implementation does this by iterating through ranks of sorted items.\n\nAlternative for `balanced_packing`:\nInstead of iterating through `k` (rank of sorted items), we can iterate through the packs. For each pack, assign `groups_per_pack` items to it. Which items should be assigned? The `groups_per_pack` heaviest items that haven't been assigned yet. This would require a way to efficiently select the top `groups_per_pack` items from the remaining pool.\n\nHowever, the current approach is already quite vectorized. The issue might be subtle, or the regression is due to the `replicate_experts` fix being missed.\n\nLet's propose the fix for `replicate_experts` as the primary change. Then, let's look for a simplification in `rebalance_experts_hierarchical`.\n\nThe complex line:\n`pphy2mlog = (pphy2mlog.view(num_layers, num_nodes, -1) + torch.arange(0, num_logical_experts, num_logical_experts // num_nodes, device=group_pack_index.device).view(1, -1, 1)).flatten(-2)`\n\nThis line combines the logical expert index within a node with the node offset.\n`pphy2mlog` here is `[num_layers * num_nodes, num_phy_per_gpu]`.\n`pphy2mlog.view(num_layers, num_nodes, -1)` gives `[num_layers, num_nodes, num_phy_per_gpu]`.\nThe `torch.arange(...)` creates offsets for each node: `[0, G, 2G, ..., (N-1)G]` where `G = num_logical_experts // num_nodes` and `N = num_nodes`. This is reshaped to `[1, num_nodes, 1]`.\nAdding them: `[num_layers, num_nodes, num_phy_per_gpu] + [1, num_nodes, 1]` broadcasts to `[num_layers, num_nodes, num_phy_per_gpu]` correctly.\nThe result is the logical expert index within its node-group.\n\nThe subsequent line:\n`pphy2log = mlog2log.gather(-1, pphy2mlog)`\n`mlog2log` is `[num_layers * num_nodes, num_groups_per_node * group_size]`.\n`pphy2mlog` is `[num_layers, num_nodes, num_phy_per_gpu]`.\nThis gather is problematic because the shapes don't match for direct gathering.\n\nLet's re-examine the roles of these tensors.\n`mlog2log`: `[num_layers * num_nodes, num_logical_experts // num_nodes]`. Maps node-local logical expert index to global logical expert index.\n`phy2mlog`: `[num_layers * num_nodes, num_phy_per_gpu]`. Maps physical experts (within a node) to their node-local logical expert index.\n\nThe goal of the complex line and the final gather is to get `pphy2log` which is `[num_layers, num_physical_experts]`, representing the global logical expert ID for each physical expert.\n\nLet's trace `pphy2mlog` creation carefully.\n`phy2mlog` is `[n * num_nodes, num_logical_experts // num_nodes]` where `n = num_layers`.\n`pphy2phy` is `[n * num_nodes, num_physical_experts // num_nodes]`.\n`pphy2mlog = phy2mlog.gather(-1, pphy2phy)` results in `[n * num_nodes, num_physical_experts // num_nodes]`. This is the node-local logical expert index for each physical expert.\n\nNow, this `pphy2mlog` needs to be mapped to the final `num_physical_experts` dimension.\nThe `num_physical_experts` are distributed across `num_gpus`. Each GPU gets `phy_experts_per_gpu`.\nThe `balanced_packing(tokens_per_phy, num_gpus // num_nodes)` packs physical experts *within each node* onto GPUs.\n`pack_index`: `[n * num_nodes, num_phy_per_gpu]`. The GPU index (within the node's GPUs) for each physical expert.\n`rank_in_pack`: `[n * num_nodes, num_phy_per_gpu]`. The rank of the physical expert on that GPU.\n`phy2pphy = pack_index * phy_experts_per_gpu + rank_in_pack`: This calculates the final physical expert ID *within the node's total physical experts*.\nThis `phy2pphy` should be `[n * num_nodes, num_phy_per_gpu]`.\n\nThe issue might be in the interpretation of `num_physical_experts // num_nodes` and `num_gpus // num_nodes`.\n`num_physical_experts` is the total.\n`phy_experts_per_gpu = num_physical_experts // num_gpus`.\n`num_phy_per_gpu = num_physical_experts // num_gpus`.\n\nThe `balanced_packing` is done for `num_gpus // num_nodes` bins. This is correct if we are packing physical experts onto GPUs.\n\nThe line that seems problematic is:\n`pphy2mlog = (pphy2mlog.view(num_layers, num_nodes, -1) + torch.arange(0, num_logical_experts, num_logical_experts // num_nodes, device=group_pack_index.device).view(1, -1, 1)).flatten(-2)`\nHere `pphy2mlog` is `[n * num_nodes, num_phy_per_gpu]`.\nThe `view` is `[n, num_nodes, num_phy_per_gpu]`.\nThe `torch.arange` creates offsets for the `num_logical_experts // num_nodes` groups of logical experts per node.\nThis addition results in `[n, num_nodes, num_phy_per_gpu]`.\nThe `flatten(-2)` results in `[n, num_nodes * num_phy_per_gpu]`.\n`num_nodes * num_phy_per_gpu = num_nodes * (num_physical_experts // num_gpus)`.\nIf `num_gpus` is a multiple of `num_nodes`, let `num_gpus = k * num_nodes`.\nThen `num_phy_per_gpu = num_physical_experts // (k * num_nodes)`.\n`num_nodes * num_phy_per_gpu = num_nodes * num_physical_experts / (k * num_nodes) = num_physical_experts / k = num_physical_experts / (num_gpus / num_nodes) = num_physical_experts * num_nodes / num_gpus`.\nThis is the number of physical experts *per node*.\nSo, `pphy2mlog` after flattening is `[num_layers, num_experts_per_node]`. This is not the final `num_physical_experts`.\n\nThe `mlog2log` is `[n * num_nodes, num_logical_experts // num_nodes]`.\nThe final gather `pphy2log = mlog2log.gather(-1, pphy2mlog)` requires `pphy2mlog` to have dimensions compatible with `mlog2log`.\n\nLet's assume the intent is to get the final `[num_layers, num_physical_experts]` mapping.\nThe `pphy2phy` maps physical experts to their position within the node's total physical experts.\nThe `phy2mlog` maps physical experts (within a node) to their node-local logical expert index.\n\nThe correct way to combine these might be:\n1.  Get the logical expert index for each physical expert on a GPU.\n2.  Map this to the global logical expert index.\n\nLet's re-examine the `replicate_experts` function. The bug identified (`max` vs `min`) is critical for balancedness.\n\nFor speed and simplification, let's focus on the `balanced_packing` function. The current implementation sorts all items and then greedily assigns. If `num_groups` is large, sorting `num_groups` items for each layer can be time-consuming.\n\nConsider `torch.topk(weight, k=groups_per_pack, dim=-1, largest=True, sorted=True)` to get the `groups_per_pack` largest items. This could be an alternative to sorting the whole tensor. However, the current loop iterates through `k` from 0 to `num_groups`, implying it needs the full sorted order.\n\nLet's make the `replicate_experts` fix.\n\n```python\n# Current code\n        redundant_indices = (weight / logcnt).max(dim=-1).indices\n```\n\n```python\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        redundant_indices = (weight / logcnt).max(dim=-1).indices\n=======\n        # Find the logical expert with the minimum load per replica.\n        # The load per replica is weight / logcnt.\n        # We want to find the minimum of this ratio.\n        redundant_indices = (weight / logcnt).min(dim=-1).indices\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\nThis is the most critical fix for balancedness.\n\nNow, for speed and simplification. The prompt mentions \"Consider simplifying the code to improve readability and maintainability\".\nThe complex indexing in `rebalance_experts_hierarchical` is a candidate.\n\nLet's look at the `replicate_experts` function itself. The loop runs `num_redundant` times. Inside, `(weight / logcnt)` is computed. This division is done repeatedly. If `logcnt` is large, this can be slow. However, `logcnt` represents the number of replicas, which is usually small.\n\nConsider the `balanced_packing` function. The issue of regression suggests that the current implementation might be suboptimal.\nThe core of `balanced_packing` is the loop over `k` and the greedy assignment.\n\nA possible simplification for `balanced_packing`:\nInstead of iterating `k` from `0` to `num_groups`, we can think about how to fill each pack.\nFor each pack, we need to assign `groups_per_pack` items. The greedy strategy suggests picking the heaviest available items.\n\nLet's re-examine the line `log2mlog = (((group_pack_index * groups_per_node + group_rank_in_pack) * group_size).unsqueeze(-1) + torch.arange(group_size, dtype=torch.int64, device=group_pack_index.device)).flatten(-2)`\n\nThis line constructs the mapping from the logical experts *within a node's packed groups* to their global logical expert IDs.\n`group_pack_index`: `[num_layers, num_nodes]` - which node each group is packed into.\n`group_rank_in_pack`: `[num_layers, num_nodes]` - rank within the node's packing.\n`groups_per_node`: number of groups per node.\n`group_size`: number of logical experts per group.\n\nThe part `group_pack_index * groups_per_node + group_rank_in_pack` gives the index of the \"node-local group\" for each original group. Let's call this `node_group_idx`. This is `[num_layers, num_groups]`.\n\nThen `node_group_idx * group_size` gives the starting global logical expert index for each node-local group. This is `[num_layers, num_groups]`.\n\nThe unsqueeze and add `torch.arange(group_size)` is to map the `group_size` logical experts within each group.\nSo, `log2mlog` becomes `[num_layers, num_groups, group_size]`, which is `[num_layers, num_logical_experts]`. This seems correct.\n\nThe issue might be in the subsequent `mlog2log = inverse(log2mlog)`. This creates the inverse mapping.\n\nLet's focus on the `replicate_experts` fix. It's a concrete bug that directly impacts balancedness.\n\nFor speed and simplification, the prompt mentions \"Consider simplifying the code to improve readability and maintainability\". The complex indexing in `rebalance_experts_hierarchical` is a prime candidate.\n\nThe line:\n`pphy2mlog = (pphy2mlog.view(num_layers, num_nodes, -1) + torch.arange(0, num_logical_experts, num_logical_experts // num_nodes, device=group_pack_index.device).view(1, -1, 1)).flatten(-2)`\n\nThis line calculates the logical expert index within its node-group for each physical expert that ends up on a particular GPU. The `flatten(-2)` creates a tensor of shape `[num_layers, num_experts_per_node]`. This is not the final `num_physical_experts` dimension.\n\nThe final mapping is `pphy2log = mlog2log.gather(-1, pphy2mlog)`.\n`mlog2log` is `[num_layers * num_nodes, num_logical_experts // num_nodes]`.\n`pphy2mlog` is `[num_layers, num_experts_per_node]`.\n\nThis gather operation is incorrect. The dimensions do not align.\n\nLet's try to simplify the mapping from physical experts to logical experts.\nWe have `phy2mlog` which maps physical experts (within a node) to their node-local logical expert index.\nWe have `pphy2phy` which maps physical experts to their final position within the node's physical experts.\n\nLet's try to reconstruct the `pphy2log` mapping more directly.\n\nThe `replicate_experts` function returns `phy2log` of shape `[num_layers * num_nodes, num_phy_per_gpu]`. This is the node-local logical expert index for each physical expert *on a GPU*.\n\nThe `balanced_packing` for GPUs returns `pack_index` and `rank_in_pack`.\n`phy2pphy = pack_index * phy_experts_per_gpu + rank_in_pack` maps physical experts to their final index within the node's total physical experts. This is `[num_layers * num_nodes, num_phy_per_gpu]`.\n\nWe need to map `[num_layers, num_physical_experts]` to `[num_layers, num_logical_experts]`.\n\nLet's reconsider the `replicate_experts` function. The fix for `max` to `min` is essential.\n\nFor speed and simplification, let's target the complex indexing.\nThe line `pphy2mlog = (pphy2mlog.view(num_layers, num_nodes, -1) + torch.arange(0, num_logical_experts, num_logical_experts // num_nodes, device=group_pack_index.device).view(1, -1, 1)).flatten(-2)` is problematic in its final dimension calculation and subsequent gather.\n\nLet's simplify the calculation of `pphy2log`.\n`phy2mlog` is the mapping from `[num_layers * num_nodes, num_phy_per_gpu]` to `[num_layers * num_nodes, num_logical_experts // num_nodes]`. This is the node-local logical expert index.\n\nWe have `pphy2phy` which gives the final physical expert index *within the node*. Let's call it `final_phy_idx_in_node`.\nThe `phy2mlog` needs to be indexed by `pphy2phy`.\nSo, `node_local_log_idx = phy2mlog.gather(-1, pphy2phy)`. This results in `[num_layers * num_nodes, num_phy_per_gpu]`.\n\nNow, `node_local_log_idx` contains indices from `0` to `num_logical_experts // num_nodes - 1`.\nWe need to convert these to global logical expert indices.\nThe offset for each node is `0, G, 2G, ..., (N-1)G` where `G = num_logical_experts // num_nodes`.\nLet `node_offsets = torch.arange(0, num_logical_experts, num_logical_experts // num_nodes, device=weight.device)`. This is `[num_nodes]`.\nWe need to apply this offset based on which node the physical expert belongs to.\n\nThe `phy2mlog` and `pphy2phy` are indexed by `[num_layers * num_nodes, num_phy_per_gpu]`.\nThis indexing implicitly assumes a structure where the first `num_nodes` blocks of physical experts belong to node 0, the next `num_nodes` blocks to node 1, etc. This is not how `pphy2phy` is constructed.\n\n`pphy2phy` is constructed from `pack_index` and `rank_in_pack` which are `[num_layers * num_nodes, num_phy_per_gpu]`.\n\nLet's consider the final shape: `physical_to_logical_map: [layers, num_replicas]`.\nThis means for each physical expert, we need its logical expert ID.\n\nThe `replicate_experts` function returns `phy2log` which is `[num_layers * num_nodes, num_phy_per_gpu]`. This is the logical expert ID for physical experts *within a node*.\n\nThe `pphy2phy` maps physical experts to their final position `[num_layers, num_physical_experts]`.\nThe `phy2mlog` maps physical experts within a node to their node-local logical expert ID.\n\nLet's simplify the mapping to `pphy2log`.\nWe have `phy2mlog` (`[n*num_nodes, num_phy_per_gpu]`). This is the node-local logical expert index.\nWe have `pphy2phy` (`[n*num_nodes, num_phy_per_gpu]`). This is the final physical expert index within the node.\n\nLet's try to reconstruct the `[num_layers, num_physical_experts]` mapping.\nThe `num_physical_experts` are distributed across `num_gpus`.\nThe `balanced_packing` for GPUs uses `num_gpus // num_nodes` bins.\n\nLet's reconsider the current code's intent.\nThe line `pphy2mlog = phy2mlog.gather(-1, pphy2phy)` is likely intended to map the node-local logical expert index (`phy2mlog`) to the final physical expert index (`pphy2phy`). This is still within the node's flattened structure.\n\nThe complex line is:\n`pphy2mlog = (pphy2mlog.view(num_layers, num_nodes, -1) + torch.arange(0, num_logical_experts, num_logical_experts // num_nodes, device=group_pack_index.device).view(1, -1, 1)).flatten(-2)`\nThis is where the logical expert index within the node is converted to a global logical expert index.\nLet `G = num_logical_experts // num_nodes`.\nThe `arange` is `[0, G, 2G, ..., (N-1)G]`.

This is the node-local logical expert index.\nWe need to convert this to global logical expert index.\nThis requires knowing which node each physical expert belongs to.\n\nThe `pphy2phy` is `[n*num_nodes, num_phy_per_gpu]`, the final physical expert index within the node.\nThe `phy2mlog` is `[n*num_nodes, num_phy_per_gpu]`, the node-local logical expert index.\n\nLet's try to get the final mapping `pphy2log` directly.\n`phy2mlog` is the logical expert ID within the node.\nWe need to convert this to a global logical expert ID.\nThe `mlog2log` maps node-local logical expert index to global logical expert index.\nThe problem is that `mlog2log` is indexed by `[n*num_nodes, G]`.\n\nLet's rethink the structure of `replicate_experts`.

This is the final physical expert index for each physical expert.\nThe `phy2mlog` is `[num_layers * num_nodes, num_logical_experts // num_nodes]`. This is the node-local logical expert index for each physical expert.\n\nLet's consider the `num_physical_experts` dimension. It is `num_gpus * phy_experts_per_gpu`.\nThe `balanced_packing` for GPUs is done for `num_gpus // num_nodes` bins.\nThe output `pack_index` and `rank_in_pack` are `[num_layers * num_nodes, num_phy_per_gpu]`.\n\nThe `pphy2phy` calculation is correct: `pack_index * phy_experts_per_gpu + rank_in_pack`.\nThis creates the final physical expert index within the node's total physical experts.\nThis tensor should be `[num_layers * num_nodes, num_experts_per_gpu]` where `num_experts_per_gpu` is the number of physical experts per GPU.\nThe `num_physical_experts // num_nodes` in the `replicate_experts` output is `num_experts_per_gpu`.\n\nSo, `pphy2phy` is `[num_layers * num_nodes, num_experts_per_gpu]`.\nThe `phy2mlog` is `[num_layers * num_nodes, num_experts_per_gpu]`.\n\nNow, to get `pphy2log` (`[num_layers, num_physical_experts]`).\nWe need to map `phy2mlog` to global logical experts.\nThe first `num_experts_per_gpu` columns of `phy2mlog` correspond to the first GPU's physical experts within that node.\nThe next `num_experts_per_gpu` columns correspond to the second GPU's physical experts within that node, and so on.\n\nLet's try to simplify the process of getting `pphy2log`.\nWe have `phy2mlog` which maps physical experts within a node to their node-local logical expert index.\nWe have `pphy2phy` which maps physical experts to their final index within the node.\n\nLet's consider the structure `[num_layers, num_physical_experts]`.\nThe `num_physical_experts` can be seen as `num_gpus * num_experts_per_gpu`.\nThe `num_experts_per_gpu` experts on each GPU are derived from the `num_experts_per_gpu` slots created by `replicate_experts`.\n\nThe `phy2mlog` is indexed by `[num_layers * num_nodes, num_experts_per_gpu]`.\nLet's reshape it to `[num_layers, num_nodes, num_experts_per_gpu]`.\nThis represents the node-local logical expert index for each physical expert, structured by node.\n\nNow, we need to map this node-local index to a global logical expert index.\nThe offset for each node is `0, G, 2G, ..., (N-1)G`.\nLet `node_offsets = torch.arange(0, num_logical_experts, num_logical_experts // num_nodes, device=weight.device)`. This is `[num_nodes]`.\nWe can add this offset to the `[num_layers, num_nodes, num_experts_per_gpu]` tensor.\n`global_log_idx_per_node = phy2mlog.view(num_layers, num_nodes, num_experts_per_gpu) + node_offsets.view(1, num_nodes, 1)`\nThis gives `[num_layers, num_nodes, num_experts_per_gpu]`.\n\nNow, we need to flatten this to `[num_layers, num_nodes * num_experts_per_gpu]`.\n`num_nodes * num_experts_per_gpu = num_physical_experts`.\nSo, `global_log_idx_flat = global_log_idx_per_node.flatten(1, 2)`\nThis yields `[num_layers, num_physical_experts]`. This is exactly `pphy2log`.\n\nSo, the complex line and the final gather can be replaced by this simpler mapping.\nThis improves readability and potentially speed by avoiding an unnecessary gather and complex indexing.\n\n```python\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    pphy2mlog = phy2mlog.gather(-1, pphy2phy)  # [num_layers * num_nodes, num_log_per_nodes]\n    pphy2mlog = (pphy2mlog.view(num_layers, num_nodes, -1) + torch.arange(\n        0,\n        num_logical_experts,\n        num_logical_experts // num_nodes,\n        device=group_pack_index.device,\n    ).view(1, -1, 1)).flatten(-2)\n    pphy2log = mlog2log.gather(-1, pphy2mlog)\n    pphyrank = phyrank.gather(-1, pphy2phy).view(num_layers, -1)\n    logcnt = mlogcnt.view(num_layers, -1).gather(-1, log2mlog)\n    return pphy2log, pphyrank, logcnt\n=======\n    # Map physical experts to their node-local logical expert index\n    # phy2mlog: [num_layers * num_nodes, num_experts_per_gpu]\n    # pphy2phy: [num_layers * num_nodes, num_experts_per_gpu]\n    node_local_log_idx = phy2mlog.gather(-1, pphy2phy)\n\n    # Convert node-local logical expert indices to global logical expert indices\n    # Reshape node_local_log_idx to group by node: [num_layers, num_nodes, num_experts_per_gpu]\n    node_local_log_idx_reshaped = node_local_log_idx.view(num_layers, num_nodes, -1)\n\n    # Calculate offsets for each node's logical experts\n    num_experts_per_node_group = num_logical_experts // num_nodes\n    node_offsets = torch.arange(0, num_logical_experts, num_experts_per_node_group, device=weight.device)\n    node_offsets = node_offsets.view(1, num_nodes, 1) # Reshape for broadcasting\n\n    # Add offsets to get global logical expert indices\n    global_log_idx_per_node = node_local_log_idx_reshaped + node_offsets\n\n    # Flatten to get the final [num_layers, num_physical_experts] mapping\n    pphy2log = global_log_idx_per_node.flatten(1, 2)\n\n    # The rank information needs to be aligned with the final pphy2log structure\n    # phyrank is [num_layers * num_nodes, num_experts_per_gpu]\n    # We need to reorder phyrank based on pphy2phy to align with the final physical expert ordering\n    pphyrank = phyrank.gather(-1, pphy2phy).view(num_layers, -1)\n\n    # logcnt is [num_layers * num_nodes, num_logical_experts // num_nodes]\n    # It represents the replica count for logical experts within each node's group.\n    # We need to map this to the final structure.\n    # The log2mlog maps logical experts to their node-local representation.\n    # We need to gather logcnt based on the final mapping of physical experts to logical experts.\n    # This part of the logic might need careful re-evaluation based on what logcnt represents.\n    # Assuming logcnt needs to be aligned with the final pphy2log structure.\n    # The original code used gather(-1, log2mlog), which implies log2mlog was used to index logcnt.\n    # log2mlog maps logical experts to their node-local group index.\n    # This part needs to be consistent with how pphy2log is derived.\n    # For now, let's keep the original logic for logcnt, assuming it's correctly indexed.\n    # If logcnt is per logical expert per node, then we need to map it.\n    # The original `logcnt = mlogcnt.view(num_layers, -1).gather(-1, log2mlog)`\n    # implies that mlogcnt is per logical expert per node.\n    # mlogcnt is [num_layers * num_nodes, num_logical_experts // num_nodes].\n    # log2mlog is [num_layers, num_logical_experts].\n    # The gather operation is incorrect due to shape mismatch.\n\n    # Let's re-evaluate the logcnt part.\n    # mlogcnt is the number of replicas for each logical expert *within its node's group*.\n    # mlogcnt: [num_layers * num_nodes, num_experts_per_gpu]\n    # We need to align this with the final `num_physical_experts` dimension.\n    # The structure of mlogcnt is already grouped by node and then by physical expert slot.\n    # So, we need to reshape it similar to how we reshaped phy2mlog.\n    logcnt_reshaped = mlogcnt.view(num_layers, num_nodes, -1)\n    # Then flatten it to get the final structure.\n    logcnt = logcnt_reshaped.flatten(1, 2) # [num_layers, num_physical_experts]\n\n    return pphy2log, pphyrank, logcnt\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\nThis change simplifies the mapping logic, improves readability, and potentially speeds up execution by avoiding an unnecessary gather and complex indexing. It directly calculates the `pphy2log` mapping. It also corrects the `logcnt` calculation to match the final structure.\n\nFinal check on the `replicate_experts` fix:\nThe objective is to minimize the maximum load of all replicas.\nGreedy strategy: assign the next replica to the logical expert that currently has the minimum load per replica.\nLoad per replica for logical expert `j` is `weight[i, j] / logcnt[i, j]`.\nWe want to find `j` that minimizes this ratio.\nSo, `(weight / logcnt).min(dim=-1).indices` is correct.\n\nThe original code used `.max(dim=-1).indices`. This is almost certainly a bug.\n\nSo, the proposed changes are:\n1.  Fix the bug in `replicate_experts` (replace `.max` with `.min`).\n2.  Simplify and correct the mapping logic in `rebalance_experts_hierarchical` to directly compute `pphy2log` and `logcnt`.\n\nLet's consider the `balanced_packing` function again. The regression suggests a problem there.\nThe current implementation is a greedy assignment of sorted items.\nIf the regression is due to speed, it's likely the `O(num_groups * num_packs)` loop.\nIf it's due to balancedness, it might be the greedy heuristic itself or an interaction with other parts.\n\nGiven the prompt's emphasis on simplifying code and the regression, the mapping simplification in `rebalance_experts_hierarchical` is a good candidate. The `replicate_experts` fix is a critical bug.\n\nLet's ensure the diff format is correct.\n\n```python\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    pphy2mlog = phy2mlog.gather(-1, pphy2phy)  # [num_layers * num_nodes, num_log_per_nodes]\n    pphy2mlog = (pphy2mlog.view(num_layers, num_nodes, -1) + torch.arange(\n        0,\n        num_logical_experts,\n        num_logical_experts // num_nodes,\n        device=group_pack_index.device,\n    ).view(1, -1, 1)).flatten(-2)\n    pphy2log = mlog2log.gather(-1, pphy2mlog)\n    pphyrank = phyrank.gather(-1, pphy2phy).view(num_layers, -1)\n    logcnt = mlogcnt.view(num_layers, -1).gather(-1, log2mlog)\n    return pphy2log, pphyrank, logcnt\n=======\n    # Map physical experts to their node-local logical expert index\n    # phy2mlog: [num_layers * num_nodes, num_experts_per_gpu]\n    # pphy2phy: [num_layers * num_nodes, num_experts_per_gpu]\n    node_local_log_idx = phy2mlog.gather(-1, pphy2phy)\n\n    # Convert node-local logical expert indices to global logical expert indices\n    # Reshape node_local_log_idx to group by node: [num_layers, num_nodes, num_experts_per_gpu]\n    node_local_log_idx_reshaped = node_local_log_idx.view(num_layers, num_nodes, -1)\n\n    # Calculate offsets for each node's logical experts\n    num_experts_per_node_group = num_logical_experts // num_nodes\n    node_offsets = torch.arange(0, num_logical_experts, num_experts_per_node_group, device=weight.device)\n    node_offsets = node_offsets.view(1, num_nodes, 1) # Reshape for broadcasting\n\n    # Add offsets to get global logical expert indices\n    global_log_idx_per_node = node_local_log_idx_reshaped + node_offsets\n\n    # Flatten to get the final [num_layers, num_physical_experts] mapping\n    pphy2log = global_log_idx_per_node.flatten(1, 2)\n\n    # The rank information needs to be aligned with the final pphy2log structure\n    # phyrank is [num_layers * num_nodes, num_experts_per_gpu]\n    # We need to reorder phyrank based on pphy2phy to align with the final physical expert ordering\n    pphyrank = phyrank.gather(-1, pphy2phy).view(num_layers, -1)\n\n    # mlogcnt is the number of replicas for each logical expert *within its node's group*.\n    # mlogcnt: [num_layers * num_nodes, num_experts_per_gpu]\n    # We need to align this with the final `num_physical_experts` dimension.\n    # Reshape mlogcnt to group by node and then flatten.\n    logcnt_reshaped = mlogcnt.view(num_layers, num_nodes, -1)\n    logcnt = logcnt_reshaped.flatten(1, 2) # [num_layers, num_physical_experts]\n\n    return pphy2log, pphyrank, logcnt\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\nThis diff handles the complex mapping logic.\n\nNow, the `replicate_experts` fix.\n\n```python\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ndef replicate_experts(\n        weight: torch.Tensor,\n        num_phy: int) -> tuple[torch.Tensor, torch.Tensor, torch.Tensor]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Replicate `num_log` experts to `num_phy` replicas, such that the maximum\n    load of all replicas is minimized.\n\n    Parameters:\n        weight: [X, num_log]\n        num_phy: total number of experts after replication\n\n    Returns:\n        phy2log: [X, num_phy], logical expert id of each physical expert\n        rank: [X, num_phy], the replica rank\n        logcnt: [X, num_log], number of replicas for each logical expert\n    \"\"\"\n    n, num_log = weight.shape\n    num_redundant = num_phy -

The goal of replication is to minimize the maximum load of any replica. The greedy strategy for this is to assign the next replica to the logical expert that currently has the *minimum* load per replica. Using `.max` incorrectly selects the logical expert with the *highest* load per replica, directly contradicting the objective of load balancing.\n    *   **Solution:** Replace `.max(dim=-1).indices` with `.min(dim=-1).indices` in the `replicate_experts` function. This correction ensures that replicas are assigned to the least loaded logical experts, which should significantly improve the `balancedness_score` and consequently the `combined_score`.\n\n2.  **Simplifying and Correcting Mapping in `rebalance_experts_hierarchical` for Efficiency and Readability:**\n    *   **Problem:** The current implementation in `rebalance_experts_hierarchical` uses a complex series of `gather`, `view`, `arange`, `flatten`, and `gather` operations to compute the final `pphy2log` mapping. This logic is difficult to read, maintain, and is prone to errors, as the final `gather` operation appears to have shape mismatches. This complexity can also introduce performance overhead.\n    *   **Solution:** The mapping from physical experts to their logical counterparts (`pphy2log`) can be computed more directly and efficiently. The proposed change reconstructs this mapping by:\n        *   Getting the node-local logical expert index for each physical expert.\n        *   Reshaping this index to group by node.\n        *   Adding node-specific offsets to convert node-local indices to global logical expert indices.\n        *   Flattening the result to obtain the final `[num_layers, num_physical_experts]` mapping.\n    *   **Benefits:** This simplification improves code readability and maintainability. It also eliminates unnecessary `gather` operations and complex indexing, which should lead to improved execution speed and thus a better `speed_score` and `combined_score`. The `logcnt` calculation is also adjusted to match the new, flattened structure, ensuring consistency.\n\n---\n\n**Suggested Changes:**\n\n**Change 1: Correcting `replicate_experts` for better balancedness.**\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        redundant_indices = (weight / logcnt).max(dim=-1).indices\n=======\n        # Find the logical expert with the minimum load per replica.\n        # The load per replica is weight / logcnt.\n        # We want to find the minimum of this ratio.\n        redundant_indices = (weight / logcnt).min(dim=-1).indices\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\n**Change 2: Simplifying and correcting mapping logic in `rebalance_experts_hierarchical` for efficiency and readability.**\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    pphy2mlog = phy2mlog.gather(-1, pphy2phy)  # [num_layers * num_nodes, num_log_per_nodes]\n    pphy2mlog = (pphy2mlog.view(num_layers, num_nodes, -1) + torch.arange(\n        0,\n        num_logical_experts,\n        num_logical_experts // num_nodes,\n        device=group_pack_index.device,\n    ).view(1, -1, 1)).flatten(-2)\n    pphy2log = mlog2log.gather(-1, pphy2mlog)\n    pphyrank = phyrank.gather(-1, pphy2phy).view(num_layers, -1)\n    logcnt = mlogcnt.view(num_layers, -1).gather(-1, log2mlog)\n    return pphy2log, pphyrank, logcnt\n=======\n    # Map physical experts to their node-local logical expert index\n    # phy2mlog: [num_layers * num_nodes, num_experts_per_gpu]\n    # pphy2phy: [num_layers * num_nodes, num_experts_per_gpu]\n    node_local_log_idx = phy2mlog.gather(-1, pphy2phy)\n\n    # Convert node-local logical expert indices to global logical expert indices\n    # Reshape node_local_log_idx to group by node: [num_layers, num_nodes, num_experts_per_gpu]\n    node_local_log_idx_reshaped = node_local_log_idx.view(num_layers, num_nodes, -1)\n\n    # Calculate offsets for each node's logical experts\n    num_experts_per_node_group = num_logical_experts // num_nodes\n    node_offsets = torch.arange(0, num_logical_experts, num_experts_per_node_group, device=weight.device)\n    node_offsets = node_offsets.view(1, num_nodes, 1) # Reshape for broadcasting\n\n    # Add offsets to get global logical expert indices\n    global_log_idx_per_node = node_local_log_idx_reshaped + node_offsets\n\n    # Flatten to get the final [num_layers, num_physical_experts] mapping\n    pphy2log = global_log_idx_per_node.flatten(1, 2)\n\n    # The rank information needs to be aligned with the final pphy2log structure\n    # phyrank is [num_layers * num_nodes, num_experts_per_gpu]\n    # We need to reorder phyrank based on pphy2phy to align with the final physical expert ordering\n    pphyrank = phyrank.gather(-1, pphy2phy).view(num_layers, -1)\n\n    # mlogcnt is the number of replicas for each logical expert *within its node's group*.\n    # mlogcnt: [num_layers * num_nodes, num_experts_per_gpu]\n    # We need to align this with the final `num_physical_experts` dimension.\n    # Reshape mlogcnt to group by node and then flatten.\n    logcnt_reshaped = mlogcnt.view(num_layers, num_nodes, -1)\n    logcnt = logcnt_reshaped.flatten(1, 2) # [num_layers, num_physical_experts]\n\n    return pphy2log, pphyrank, logcnt\n>>>>>>> REPLACE"]}}}
