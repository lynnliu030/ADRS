This can lead to suboptimal load balancing.\n\nThe goal is to improve both balancedness and speed. The current `speed_score` is quite low, indicating the algorithm itself might be slow.\n\nHere's a plan to address these issues:\n\n1.  **Refine the fallback logic**: Instead of always defaulting to a global strategy, we can adapt the hierarchical strategy to handle cases where `num_groups` is not perfectly divisible by `num_nodes`. This can be done by strategically grouping the remaining groups.\n\n2.  **Optimize `replicate_experts`**: The `replicate_experts` function has a loop that iterates `num_phy - num_log` times. Inside this loop, it performs operations that could potentially be vectorized or optimized. Specifically, the repeated `max(dim=-1).indices` and subsequent updates can be a bottleneck.\n\n3.  **Explore `balanced_packing` for efficiency**: While `balanced_packing` seems reasonable, there might be opportunities to optimize its internal operations, especially the `temp_pack_weights` cloning and manipulation.\n\nLet's start with refining the fallback logic and optimizing `replicate_experts`.\n\n### Improvement 1: More robust hierarchical grouping when `num_groups % num_nodes != 0`\n\nThe current code has a conditional:\n```python\n    if num_groups % num_nodes == 0:\n        # use hierarchical load-balance policy\n        phy2log, phyrank, logcnt = rebalance_experts_hierarchical(\n            weight, num_replicas, num_groups, num_nodes, num_gpus)\n    else:\n        # use global load-balance policy\n        phy2log, phyrank, logcnt = rebalance_experts_hierarchical(\n            weight, num_replicas, 1, 1, num_gpus)\n```\nWhen `num_groups` is not divisible by `num_nodes`, it resorts to a global policy (effectively treating all groups as one). A better approach would be to still leverage the hierarchical structure by grouping the remainder. This means `num_groups` would be adjusted, or the `rebalance_experts_hierarchical` function needs to handle uneven group distribution.\n\nFor simplicity and to avoid major refactoring of `rebalance_experts_hierarchical`, we can modify how `num_groups` and `num_nodes` are passed to it when the divisibility condition fails. We can aim to create `num_nodes` (or a number close to it) as balanced as possible for the initial grouping.\n\nLet's consider how to adjust `num_groups` and `num_nodes` for the hierarchical call when `num_groups % num_nodes != 0`. A common strategy is to distribute the `num_groups` as evenly as possible among `num_nodes`.\n\nAlternatively, we can modify `rebalance_experts_hierarchical` to accept `num_groups` and `num_nodes` and handle the uneven distribution internally. Given the prompt focuses on improving the *existing* `rebalance_experts` function, we'll adjust the call to `rebalance_experts_hierarchical`.\n\nA simpler approach for the `else` block might be to still use the hierarchical logic but adjust the parameters to make the divisions as even as possible. For example, if `num_groups = 10` and `num_nodes = 3`, we could aim for groups of size 3, 3, 4. This would require modifying `rebalance_experts_hierarchical` to accept a list of group sizes or to handle `num_groups` not being a multiple of `num_nodes`.\n\nHowever, looking at the current implementation of `rebalance_experts_hierarchical`, it strictly assumes `num_logical_experts % num_groups == 0` and `num_groups % num_nodes == 0`. This implies that the current fallback is likely a simplification.\n\nLet's focus on optimizing `replicate_experts` first, as it's a clear candidate for speed improvement. The current `replicate_experts` function iterates `num_redundant` times. Inside the loop, it calculates `max(dim=-1).indices` and then updates `logcnt`.\n\n### Optimization for `replicate_experts`\n\nThe core of `replicate_experts` is this loop:\n```python\n    for i in range(num_log, num_phy):\n        redundant_indices = (weight / logcnt).max(dim=-1).indices\n        phy2log[:, i] = redundant_indices\n        rank[:, i] = logcnt[arangen, redundant_indices]\n        logcnt[arangen, redundant_indices] += 1\n```\nThis loop assigns the `i`-th physical expert. It finds the logical expert that would benefit most from an additional replica (by maximizing `weight / logcnt`).\n\nThe `max(dim=-1).indices` operation is performed `num_phy - num_log` times. If `num_phy` is much larger than `num_log`, this can be slow.\n\nA more efficient approach might be to sort all potential assignments and pick the best ones. However, a simpler optimization could be to avoid repeated calculations if possible.\n\nLet's consider the `(weight / logcnt)` calculation. `logcnt` changes in each iteration.\n\nOne way to potentially speed this up is to use a min-heap to keep track of the \"potential gain\" for each logical expert, but this adds complexity.\n\nA more direct optimization without changing the core logic too much:\nThe calculation `weight / logcnt` is repeated. `logcnt` is updated.\n\nConsider this: for each logical expert, we want to assign replicas. The decision of which logical expert gets the *next* replica is based on `weight / current_replica_count`.\n\nLet's analyze the calculation `(weight / logcnt).max(dim=-1).indices`. This finds the logical expert that, if given one more replica, would have the highest `weight / (current_replica_count + 1)` value *among those that can still receive a replica*. The `logcnt` tensor tracks the number of replicas for each logical expert.\n\nThe current code uses `arangen` to index `logcnt` correctly.\n\nA potential optimization: instead of recalculating `max` on the entire `weight / logcnt` tensor in each iteration, we can maintain the scores and update them. However, this can be tricky with the `logcnt` updates.\n\nLet's stick to improving the existing loop structure if possible.\nThe current approach is a greedy one. It's similar to assigning tasks to workers to minimize maximum load.\n\nWhat if we pre-calculate the \"value\" of adding the k-th replica for each logical expert?\nFor a logical expert `j`, the value of adding its `k`-th replica (where `k = logcnt[j]`) is `weight[j] / k`. We want to pick the logical expert that maximizes this value at each step.\n\nThis can be framed as selecting `num_phy - num_log` items from a set of available \"replica slots\", where each slot has a value.\n\nLet's try to optimize the calculation of `redundant_indices`.\nWe are essentially picking `num_phy - num_log` times from `num_log` logical experts.\nFor each logical expert `j`, we can generate a sequence of values: `weight[j]/1`, `weight[j]/2`, `weight[j]/3`, ...\nWe then need to pick `num_phy - num_log` values from the union of these sequences, ensuring that we don't pick the `k`-th value for logical expert `j` if we haven't already picked the `(k-1)`-th.\n\nThis sounds like a priority queue or sorting problem.\n\nLet's refine the `replicate_experts` function.\nThe current loop iterates `num_redundant` times.\nInside the loop:\n1.  `weight / logcnt`: This is an element-wise division.\n2.  `.max(dim=-1)`: Finds the maximum value and its index.\n3.  `logcnt[arangen, redundant_indices] += 1`: Updates the count for the chosen logical expert.\n\nThe `weight` tensor is `[n, num_log]`. `logcnt` is `[n, num_log]`.\n`redundant_indices` is `[n]`.\n`arangen` is `[n]`.\n\nThe operations are:\n`weight / logcnt`: `[n, num_log]`\n`.max(dim=-1)`: returns `values [n]`, `indices [n]`\n`logcnt[arangen, redundant_indices]`: indexing into `logcnt` using `arangen` and `redundant_indices`. This is `[n]`.\n`+= 1`: updates `logcnt`.\n\nThe problem is that `max(dim=-1)` is called `num_redundant` times.\nIf `num_redundant` is large, this is slow.\n\nConsider an alternative approach for `replicate_experts`:\nInstead of iteratively picking the best logical expert, we can generate all \"potential replica values\" and sort them.\n\nFor each logical expert `j` (from `0` to `num_log-1`):\nGenerate pairs `(value, logical_expert_index)` for its potential replicas.\nThe value for the `k`-th replica of logical expert `j` is `weight[j] / k`.\nSo, for each `j`, we generate `(weight[j]/1, j), (weight[j]/2, j), (weight[j]/3, j), ...` up to a reasonable limit (or until the value becomes negligible).\n\nThen, we collect all these pairs from all logical experts and sort them in descending order of `value`. We take the top `num_phy - num_log` pairs. The `logical_expert_index` from these pairs tells us which logical expert to assign the new replica to. We also need to keep track of the rank.\n\nLet's try to implement this more efficient version of `replicate_experts`.\n\n**Revised `replicate_experts` logic:**\n\n1.  Calculate the maximum possible number of replicas for any logical expert. This is `num_phy // num_log` if `num_phy` is a multiple of `num_log`, or slightly more if not. A safe upper bound is `num_phy`.\n2.  For each logical expert `j` and for `k` from 1 up to `max_k`:\n    Calculate `value = weight[j] / k`.\n    Store `(value, j, k)` where `j` is the logical expert index and `k` is the replica rank (1-indexed).\n3.  Flatten these tuples into a single list.\n4.  Sort this list in descending order of `value`.\n5.  Take the top `num_redundant = num_phy - num_log` entries.\n6.  From these top entries, construct `phy2log`, `rank`, and `logcnt`.\n\nLet's refine this. `weight` is `[n, num_log]`.\nWe need to assign `num_phy` physical experts in total.\nWe start with `num_log` physical experts, each being a single replica of a logical expert.\nWe need to add `num_redundant = num_phy - num_log` more physical experts.\n\nFor each logical expert `j` (from `0` to `num_log-1`):\nIt has `logcnt[j]` replicas initially.\nThe \"gain\" from adding the `k`-th replica for logical expert `j` is `weight[j] / k`.\n\nWe can create a list of all possible \"replica opportunities\":\n`opportunities = []`\n`for layer in range(n):`\n  `for log_expert in range(num_log):`\n    `for k in range(1, num_phy + 1):  # Potentially up to num_phy replicas`\n      `value = weight[layer, log_expert] / k`\n      `opportunities.append((value, log_expert, k))`\n\nThen sort `opportunities` by `value` descending.\nTake the top `num_redundant` opportunities.\nAssign `phy2log`, `rank`, `logcnt` based on these.\n\nThe tricky part is `logcnt` is a tensor `[n, num_log]`.\nThe loop in `replicate_experts` is operating on `[n, num_log]` dimensions.\nSo `weight` is `[num_layers, num_logical_experts]`.\n`num_log` is `num_logical_experts`.\n`num_phy` is `num_physical_experts`.\n\nLet's re-examine `replicate_experts` signature and usage.\nIt's called with `tokens_per_mlog` which is `[num_layers * num_nodes, num_logical_experts // num_nodes]`.\nSo `n` in `replicate_experts` is `num_layers * num_nodes`.\n`num_log` is `num_logical_experts // num_nodes`.\n\nThe `weight` passed to `replicate_experts` is `tokens_per_mlog`.\n`logcnt` is initialized as `torch.ones(n, num_log, dtype=torch.int64, device=device)`.\n\nThe loop:\n`for i in range(num_log, num_phy):`\n  `redundant_indices = (weight / logcnt).max(dim=-1).indices`\n  `phy2log[:, i] = redundant_indices`\n  `rank[:, i] = logcnt[arangen, redundant_indices]`\n  `logcnt[arangen, redundant_indices] += 1`\n\nThis means `phy2log` is `[n, num_phy]`.\n`rank` is `[n, num_phy]`.\n`logcnt` is `[n, num_log]`.\n\nThe issue is that `num_phy` here is `num_physical_experts // num_nodes`.\nSo the loop runs `(num_physical_experts // num_nodes) - (num_logical_experts // num_nodes)` times.\n\nThe total number of physical experts is `num_physical_experts`.\nThe number of physical experts per GPU is `num_physical_experts // num_gpus`.\nThe number of logical experts per node is `num_logical_experts // num_nodes`.\n\nLet's analyze `rebalance_experts_hierarchical` again.\nIt calls `replicate_experts` with `tokens_per_mlog` which has shape `[num_layers * num_nodes, num_logical_experts // num_nodes]`.\nThe target number of physical experts *per node* is `num_physical_experts // num_nodes`.\nSo, `n` for `replicate_experts` is `num_layers * num_nodes`.\n`num_log` for `replicate_experts` is `num_logical_experts // num_nodes`.\n`num_phy` for `replicate_experts` is `num_physical_experts // num_nodes`.\n\nSo the loop in `replicate_experts` runs `(num_physical_experts // num_nodes) - (num_logical_experts // num_nodes)` times.\nIf `num_physical_experts` is much larger than `num_logical_experts`, this loop can be slow.\n\n**Optimization Strategy for `replicate_experts`:**\n\nWe want to assign `num_phy` physical experts to `num_log` logical experts, given the `weight` matrix `[n, num_log]`. The objective is to minimize the maximum load per physical expert. This is achieved by greedily adding replicas to the logical expert that offers the best \"value\" (weight / current_replica_count).\n\nInstead of iterating and finding the max `num_phy - num_log` times, we can generate all potential \"gains\" and pick the top ones.\n\nFor each logical expert `j` (from `0` to `num_log-1`):\nThe gain from its 1st replica is `weight[:, j] / 1`.\nThe gain from its 2nd replica is `weight[:, j] / 2`.\n...\nThe gain from its `k`-th replica is `weight[:, j] / k`.\n\nWe can create a list of all `(gain_value, logical_expert_index)` pairs for all possible replica additions and sort them.\n\nLet's refine the data structures for this.\n`n` = `num_layers * num_nodes`\n`num_log` = `num_logical_experts // num_nodes`\n`num_phy` = `num_physical_experts // num_nodes`\n\nWe need to select `num_phy` physical experts in total.\nInitial state: `num_log` physical experts, each mapping to one logical expert.\nWe need to add `num_redundant = num_phy - num_log` more physical experts.\n\nFor each logical expert `j` (index from `0` to `num_log - 1`):\nIt currently has 1 replica.\nThe \"value\" of adding the 2nd replica is `weight[:, j] / 2`.\nThe \"value\" of adding the 3rd replica is `weight[:, j] / 3`.\n...\nThe \"value\" of adding the `k`-th replica is `weight[:, j] / k`.\n\nWe can generate all these potential \"values\" for each logical expert.\nLet `all_replica_gains` be a list of tuples `(gain_value, logical_expert_idx)`.\n\nFor `j` in `range(num_log)`:\n  For `k` in `range(2, num_phy + 1)`:  // Start from 2nd replica\n    `gain = weight[:, j] / k`\n    `all_replica_gains.append((gain, j))`\n\nThis `gain` is a tensor of shape `[n]`. We need to aggregate this.\nThe `max(dim=-1)` in the original code is applied to `weight / logcnt`, which is `[n, num_log]`. This means it's finding the logical expert `j` that maximizes `weight[:, j] / logcnt[:, j]`.\n\nThe optimization should aim to make this selection process faster.\nInstead of repeatedly finding the max, we can generate all candidates and sort.\n\nLet's consider the pairs `(value, logical_expert_index)` where `value` is `weight[:, j] / k`.\nWe want to select `num_redundant` such pairs.\n\nThis is equivalent to:\nFor each logical expert `j`, we have a sequence of potential gains:\n`gains_j = [weight[:, j]/1, weight[:, j]/2, weight[:, j]/3, ...]`\nWe want to pick `num_phy` items from the union of `gains_j` such that we pick at most one item from each \"rank\" `k` for a given `j`.\n\nThis is a bit like the \"k-th smallest element in a sorted matrix\" problem, but with more dimensions.\n\nLet's try the following approach for `replicate_experts`:\n\n1.  Initialize `phy2log` and `rank` as before.\n2.  Create a list of all potential assignments: `potential_assignments = []`.\n3.  For each logical expert `j` (from `0` to `num_log - 1`):\n    For `k` from `1` to `num_phy`:  // The k-th replica\n      Calculate the \"score\" for this assignment. The score is the average load per replica if this logical expert gets its `k`-th replica.\n      This is `weight[:, j] / k`.\n      We want to pick assignments that *reduce* the overall imbalance.\n      The current greedy approach picks the logical expert that has the highest `weight / current_replica_count`.\n\nLet's try to reframe the problem to use sorting:\nFor each logical expert `j`, we have a sequence of values representing the \"quality\" of adding its `k`-th replica: `Q_j(k) = weight[:, j] / k`.\nWe need to select `num_phy` assignments in total.\nInitially, we have `num_log` assignments (the 1st replica for each logical expert).\nWe need to select `num_redundant` additional assignments.\n\nConsider all possible `(Q_j(k), j)` pairs for `k = 1, 2, ... num_phy`.\nWe want to select `num_phy` such pairs, such that for any `j`, we select at most one pair for each `k`.\nWe greedily pick the `num_redundant` pairs with the highest `Q_j(k)` values, respecting the constraint that we can only pick the `k`-th replica if the `(k-1)`-th replica has already been \"accounted for\" in our selection.\n\nThis can be done by generating all `(Q_j(k), j, k)` tuples, sorting them by `Q_j(k)` descending, and then filtering to ensure the `k`-th replica is only picked if the `(k-1)`-th has been picked for the same `j`.\n\nLet's simplify:\nThe current loop is `for i in range(num_log, num_phy)`. This loop is adding the `i`-th physical expert.\nThe decision is made by `(weight / logcnt).max(dim=-1).indices`. This finds the `j` that maximizes `weight[:, j] / logcnt[:, j]`.\n\nLet's try to optimize this specific calculation.\n`score = weight / logcnt`\n`best_logical_expert_indices = torch.argmax(score, dim=-1)`\n\nInstead of calling `argmax` repeatedly, we can calculate all scores first, then manage them.\nThis is still tricky because `logcnt` changes.\n\nWhat if we use `torch.topk`?\n`torch.topk(score, k=num_redundant, dim=-1, largest=True, sorted=False)`\nThis would give us the `num_redundant` best logical experts *at that moment*. But we still need to update `logcnt` and re-evaluate.\n\nLet's consider the problem as picking `num_phy` items from `num_log` \"bins\", where each bin `j` has items `weight[:, j]/1, weight[:, j]/2, ..., weight[:, j]/num_phy`. We want to pick `num_phy` items in total, with at most one item per rank `k` from each bin `j`.\n\nWe can create a list of all candidate assignments:\n`candidates = []`\n`for layer_idx in range(n):`\n  `for log_idx in range(num_log):`\n    `for rank_val in range(1, num_phy + 1):`\n      `score = weight[layer_idx, log_idx] / rank_val`\n      `candidates.append((score, log_idx, rank_val))`\n\nSort `candidates` by `score` descending.\nThen, iterate through the sorted `candidates` and pick the first `num_redundant` valid assignments. A valid assignment `(score, log_idx, rank_val)` is one where `rank_val` has not been assigned to `log_idx` yet.\n\nThis approach seems more promising for speed.\n\n**Implementation Details for the new `replicate_experts`:**\n\n1.  `n, num_log = weight.shape`\n2.  `num_redundant = num_phy - num_log`\n3.  `all_scores = []`\n4.  `for j in range(num_log):`\n    `for k in range(1, num_phy + 1):`\n      `score = weight[:, j] / k`\n      `all_scores.append((score, j, k))`\n5.  Sort `all_scores` by `score` in descending order.\n6.  Initialize `phy2log`, `rank`, `logcnt` as before.\n7.  `assigned_ranks = torch.zeros(n, num_log, dtype=torch.int64, device=device)`\n8.  `current_phy_idx = 0`\n9.  `for score, log_idx, rank_val in all_scores:`\n    `if current_phy_idx >= num_phy:`\n      `break`\n    `if assigned_ranks[torch.arange(n), log_idx] < rank_val:`\n      `phy2log[:, current_phy_idx] = log_idx`\n      `rank[:, current_phy_idx] = rank_val - 1  # rank is 0-indexed`\n      `assigned_ranks[torch.arange(n), log_idx] = rank_val`\n      `current_phy_idx += 1`\n10. Return `phy2log`, `rank`, `logcnt`. (Note: `logcnt` is not directly used in the output construction here, but the logic of `assigned_ranks` implicitly tracks it). The original function returns `logcnt` which is the number of replicas. We can derive this from `assigned_ranks`.\n\nLet's reconsider the output of `replicate_experts`. It returns `phy2log`, `rank`, `logcnt`.\n`phy2log`: `[n, num_phy]`, logical expert id of each physical expert.\n`rank`: `[n, num_phy]`, the replica rank (0-indexed) of each physical expert.\n`logcnt`: `[n, num_log]`, number of replicas for each logical expert.\n\nThe `rank_val - 1` in my proposed step 9 is for the `rank` output.\nThe `logcnt` output needs to be constructed. `logcnt[layer, log_idx]` should be the number of replicas assigned to `log_idx` in that `layer`. This is simply the maximum `rank_val` assigned to `log_idx` across all layers.\n\nThe `assigned_ranks` tensor already tracks this. So `logcnt` can be `assigned_ranks`.\n\nLet's refine the `all_scores` generation and processing.\nThe `weight` is `[n, num_log]`.\n`score` is `[n]`.\n`all_scores` will be a list of `(score_tensor, log_idx, rank_val)`.\n\nWe need to sort these `n * num_log * num_phy` potential assignments. This can be a lot.\nThe number of entries in `all_scores` is `n * num_log * num_phy`.\nIf `n` is large (e.g., `num_layers * num_nodes`), and `num_phy` is large, this could be slow.\n\nThe original code's complexity is roughly `O(num_redundant * n * num_log)`.\nThe new approach's complexity is roughly `O(N_cand * log(N_cand) + N_cand)` where `N_cand = n * num_log * num_phy`.\nThis is better if `num_redundant` is large and `num_phy` is large.\n\nLet's check constraints:\n`num_layers` can be large.\n`num_nodes` can be small (e.g., 1).\n`num_log` can be large.\n`num_phy` can be much larger than `num_log`.\n\nExample: `num_layers=100`, `num_nodes=1`, `num_log=128`, `num_phy=256`.\nOriginal: `num_redundant = 128`. Complexity `~ 128 * 100 * 128` operations per `max`.\nNew: `N_cand = 100 * 128 * 256`. Sorting this is expensive.\n\nThe original approach is better if `num_redundant` is small.\nThe new approach is better if `num_redundant` is large, but `num_phy` is also large.\n\nLet's reconsider the original code's performance.\n`speed_score: 0.0264` is very low. This suggests the `replicate_experts` part is indeed the bottleneck.\n\nPerhaps the issue is not the number of loop iterations, but the operations within the loop.\n`weight / logcnt` is `[n, num_log]`.\n`max(dim=-1)` is `[n]`.\n`logcnt[arangen, redundant_indices]` is `[n]`.\n\nThe bottleneck might be the repeated allocation/access of intermediate tensors if not optimized by the compiler.\n\nLet's analyze the `balanced_packing` function as well.\n`balanced_packing` sorts indices, then iterates `num_layers * num_groups * groups_per_pack` times (conceptually).\nInside the loop:\n`temp_pack_weights = current_pack_weights.clone()`: This clone happens for every item.\n`full_mask = (current_pack_items == groups_per_pack)`: Boolean mask.\n`temp_pack_weights[full_mask] = float('inf')`: Indexing assignment.\n`torch.argmin(temp_pack_weights)`: Finds the minimum.\n\nThe `clone()` and `argmin` on `temp_pack_weights` for each item can be slow.\n`temp_pack_weights` has shape `[num_packs]`. `current_pack_weights` is also `[num_packs]`.\nThis is done for each group (total `num_groups * groups_per_pack` groups).\n\nCan we optimize `balanced_packing`?\nThe core problem is assigning `N` items to `M` bins to minimize maximum bin sum, with each bin having a capacity of `N/M`. This is a variation of the multiway number partitioning problem, which is NP-hard. The greedy approach (Longest Processing Time first) is a common heuristic.\n\nThe current `balanced_packing` uses a greedy strategy: for each layer, it iterates through groups sorted by weight. For each group, it assigns it to the pack with the minimum current weight.\n\nConsider the `balanced_packing` for `tokens_per_group` which is `[num_layers, num_groups]`.\nIt needs to pack `num_groups` into `num_nodes`.\n`groups_per_pack = num_groups // num_nodes`.\nThe loop iterates `num_layers` times.\nInside, it iterates `num_groups` times (over `indices[i]`).\n\nThe `temp_pack_weights.clone()` is the main suspect for inefficiency.\nWe are modifying `temp_pack_weights` by setting full packs to infinity and then finding the minimum.\n\nAlternative for `balanced_packing`:\nInstead of cloning, can we modify `current_pack_weights` and then revert? Or use a different data structure.\nA min-heap could track the current pack weights, but updating weights in a heap when a pack becomes full is not trivial.\n\nLet's focus on `replicate_experts` first, as it seems to be the primary bottleneck.\n\n**Revised `replicate_experts` implementation attempt:**\n\nThe issue is the repeated `max(dim=-1).indices`.\nWe can reframe the selection of `num_redundant` assignments.\n\nFor each logical expert `j`, we have a sequence of scores: `S_j(k) = weight[:, j] / k` for `k = 1, ..., num_phy`.\nWe want to choose `num_phy` assignments `(j, k)` such that:\n1.  The total number of chosen assignments is `num_phy`.\n2.  For each `j`, we choose at most one assignment for each `k`.\n3.  We prioritize assignments with higher scores.\n\nThis is a \"Maximum Weight k-Set\" problem with constraints.\n\nA more practical approach:\nInstead of iterating `num_redundant` times, we can generate all `n * num_log` potential \"first replica gains\" (`weight[:, j] / 1`), then all \"second replica gains\" (`weight[:, j] / 2`), and so on.\n\nLet's try to optimize the current loop structure by reducing redundant calculations or improving tensor operations.\n\nThe original `replicate_experts`:\n```python\n    for i in range(num_log, num_phy): # Loop num_redundant times\n        # Calculate scores for all logical experts for the current replica number\n        # This is implicitly handled by logcnt changing\n        scores = weight / logcnt # [n, num_log]\n        # Find the logical expert with the highest score\n        # This is the bottleneck: argmax is computed num_redundant times\n        best_logical_expert_indices = torch.argmax(scores, dim=-1) # [n]\n\n        # Assign the i-th physical expert to the chosen logical expert\n        phy2log[:, i] = best_logical_expert_indices\n        # Record the rank of this replica\n        # rank[:, i] is the current number of replicas for best_logical_expert_indices *before* incrementing logcnt\n        rank[:, i] = logcnt[arangen, best_logical_expert_indices]\n        # Increment the replica count for the chosen logical expert\n        logcnt[arangen, best_logical_expert_indices] += 1\n```\nThe problem is `argmax` is called `num_redundant` times.\n\nAlternative: Use `torch.topk` to select the top `k` assignments.\nIf we need `num_redundant` assignments, we can think about it as selecting `num_phy` assignments in total.\n\nLet's consider the set of all possible \"replica gains\": `{(weight[:, j] / k, j, k) for j in range(num_log) for k in range(1, num_phy + 1)}`.\nWe need to select `num_phy` pairs `(j, k)` from this set, such that for any `j`, we pick at most one `k`, and for any `k`, we pick at most one `j` (this second constraint is incorrect, we can have multiple physical experts mapping to the same logical expert).\n\nThe constraint is that for a given logical expert `j`, we pick at most one of each rank `k`.\nIf we pick the `k`-th replica for logical expert `j`, its score is `weight[:, j] / k`.\n\nThe problem is to select `num_phy` pairs `(j, k)` such that the sum of `k` for each `j` does not exceed `num_phy` (this is also not quite right).\n\nLet's re-examine the original algorithm's intent. It's a greedy assignment.\nThe issue is the repeated `argmax`.\n\nWhat if we pre-calculate all `weight / k` for `k=1..num_phy`?\nThis would be `num_phy` matrices of shape `[n, num_log]`. Too much memory.\n\nThe most direct optimization is to make the `argmax` operation faster or avoid repeating it.\nThe `logcnt` changes, so we can't just compute `argmax` once.\n\nConsider the set of all `(value, log_idx)` pairs where `value = weight[:, log_idx] / logcnt[:, log_idx]`.\nWe want to pick `num_redundant` such pairs.\n\nLet's try to optimize the `replicate_experts` function by using `torch.topk` more effectively.\n\n```python\ndef replicate_experts_optimized(\n        weight: torch.Tensor,\n        num_phy: int) -> tuple[torch.Tensor, torch.Tensor, torch.Tensor]:\n    n, num_log = weight.shape\n    num_redundant = num_phy -

This is `O(n)` for each push.\nTotal cost of scores: `O(num_log * n + num_redundant * n)`.\nHeap operations: `O(num_log * log(num_log) + num_redundant * log(num_log))`.\n\nOverall complexity: `O((num_log + num_redundant) * n + (num_log + num_redundant) * log(num_log))`.\nThis is likely better than `O(num_redundant * n * num_log)` if `num_log` is large.\n\nLet's try to implement this heap-based optimization for `replicate_experts`.\n\n```python\n# SEARCH block for replicate_experts\n=======\n# REPLACE block for replicate_experts\n```\n\nThe `replicate_experts` function is located in the `rebalance_experts_hierarchical` function.\nI need to modify `rebalance_experts` to call an optimized `replicate_experts`.\nHowever, the prompt asks to improve the `rebalance_experts` function itself.\nThe `replicate_experts` function is defined as a helper function within the module.

The heap-based approach should provide a significant speedup by avoiding repeated `argmax` computations. The `balancedness_score` should remain similar as the core greedy strategy is preserved, but the efficiency of picking the next best replica is improved.\n\nOne minor point: the original `replicate_experts` initialized `phy2log` and `rank` with `arange` and `zeros`, and then filled them. My optimized version uses `empty` and then fills them. This is fine as all elements will be written.\n\nThe handling of `logcnt` as `current_logcnt` needs to be consistent. The original function returns `logcnt` which is updated in place. My version uses `current_logcnt` to track the counts and returns it. This is semantically equivalent.\n\nFinal check on the `rebalance_experts` function itself:\nThe conditional `if num_groups % num_nodes == 0:` still exists. If this condition is false, it falls back to `rebalance_experts_hierarchical(weight, num_replicas, 1, 1, num_gpus)`. This part is not changed. The improvement is purely within the `replicate_experts` helper function.\n\nThe prompt asks to improve the `rebalance_experts` function itself to achieve better load balancing and efficiency. The optimization of `replicate_experts` addresses the efficiency. For balancedness, the choice of calling `rebalance_experts_hierarchical` with adjusted parameters when `num_groups % num_nodes != 0` would be a further improvement, but it requires modifying `rebalance_experts_hierarchical` significantly, which might be beyond a simple diff. Given the current structure, optimizing the helper is the most direct path.\n\nLet's consider the `balanced_packing` optimization. The `clone()` operation is expensive.\nIf we can avoid cloning `current_pack_weights`, that would be good.\nWhen assigning an item to `pack`, we update `pack_weights_per_layer[i, pack]`. If `pack` is full, we set `temp_pack_weights[pack] = float('inf')`.\nThis modification needs to be undone or managed carefully.\n\nMaybe replace `temp_pack_weights = current_pack_weights.clone()` with:\n1.  Find the `pack` that minimizes `current_pack_weights`.\n2.  If `current_pack_items[pack] == groups_per_pack`:\n    Temporarily set `current_pack_weights[pack] = float('inf')`\n    Find the new minimum `pack`.\n    **Crucially, restore `current_pack_weights[pack]` to its original value after finding the new minimum.**\n\nThis is more complex to manage correctly. The heap-based `replicate_experts` is a more straightforward and impactful optimization.\n\nI will stick with the `replicate_experts` optimization as the primary suggestion.\n\nThe problem statement also mentions:\n\"- Metrics showing regression: speed_score, combined_score. Consider reverting or revising recent changes in these areas.\"\nThis suggests that recent changes might have degraded performance. My proposed change aims to *improve* `speed_score` by optimizing a likely bottleneck.\n\nThe prompt also mentions:\n\"- Consider simplifying the code to improve readability and maintainability\"\nThe heap-based `replicate_experts` is arguably more complex than the original loop, but it's a standard optimization technique. The overall `rebalance_experts` function itself is quite complex.\n\nThe other programs (D1, D2, Inspiration) suggest exploring alternative approaches to `balancedness_score` and `speed_score`. However, without knowing what those programs *do*, it's hard to incorporate them directly. My current suggestion targets a specific performance bottleneck.\n\nOne final thought: the `rebalance_experts` function itself has a conditional that might be suboptimal.\n```python\n    if num_groups % num_nodes == 0:\n        # use hierarchical load-balance policy\n        phy2log, phyrank, logcnt = rebalance_experts_hierarchical(\n            weight, num_replicas, num_groups, num_nodes, num_gpus)\n    else:\n        # use global load-balance policy\n        phy2log, phyrank, logcnt = rebalance_experts_hierarchical(\n            weight, num_replicas, 1, 1, num_gpus)\n```\nIf `num_groups % num_nodes != 0`, it falls back to a global policy. A more nuanced approach would be to adapt the hierarchical strategy to handle uneven group distributions. This could involve creating `num_nodes` \"super-groups\" that are as balanced as possible, even if not perfectly equal. This would likely improve `balancedness_score`.\n\nHowever, the primary request is to improve *both* balancedness and efficiency, and the `speed_score` is very low. Optimizing `replicate_experts` directly addresses the efficiency. Changing the conditional logic would address balancedness but might not be a simple diff and could introduce complexity in `rebalance_experts_hierarchical`.\n\nLet's assume the prompt's feedback about regression implies that the current `0.2983` balancedness is acceptable, and the main focus should be on `speed_score`. My change to `replicate_experts` directly targets speed.\n\nIf I were to suggest a change for balancedness, it would be to modify the `else` block.\nInstead of `rebalance_experts_hierarchical(..., 1, 1, num_gpus)`, it could try to distribute `num_groups` as evenly as possible among `num_nodes`.\nFor example, if `num_groups = 10` and `num_nodes = 3`, `groups_per_node` would be `10 // 3 = 3`.\nWe can create `num_nodes - 1` groups of size `groups_per_node` and one group of size `num_groups - (num_nodes - 1) * groups_per_node`.\nThis would require modifying `rebalance_experts_hierarchical` to accept a list of group counts or to handle this uneven distribution internally.\n\nGiven the prompt's structure, providing a diff to optimize `replicate_experts` is the most direct way to address the performance (speed) aspect.\n\nLet's confirm the prompt again: \"improve the Mixture-of-Expert models Expert Parallelism Load Balancer (MoE EPLB) expert rearrangement algorithm. This algorithm will take the load metrics recorded by the vLLM server, and rearrange the experts to balance the load. It can make replicas of some experts to achieve better load balancing. Your goal will be two-fold: 1. Improve the algorithm to achieve better load balancing; while 2. Improve the algorithm to be more efficient, i.e. reduce the execution time of the algorithm itself, since perfect load balancing is NP-hard.\"\n\nMy `replicate_experts` optimization primarily targets efficiency. The conditional fallback might hurt balancedness.\nIf I *must* suggest a change for balancedness too, I would modify the conditional.\n\nHowever, the prompt also states: \"Current performance metrics: - balancedness_score: 0.2983, - speed_score: 0.0264\". The speed score is critically low. This suggests the efficiency improvement is paramount. The balancedness score is not terrible.\n\nI will stick with the `replicate_experts` optimization for now, as it directly addresses the low `speed_score`.\n\n```python\n# The original code for rebalance_experts_hierarchical:\n# ...\n    if num_groups % num_nodes == 0:\n        # use hierarchical load-balance policy\n        phy2log, phyrank, logcnt = rebalance_experts_hierarchical(\n            weight, num_replicas, num_groups, num_nodes, num_gpus)\n    else:\n        # use global load-balance policy\n        phy2log, phyrank, logcnt = rebalance_experts_hierarchical(\n            weight, num_replicas, 1, 1, num_gpus)\n# ...\n```\nTo improve balancedness, I would suggest modifying the `else` branch.\nInstead of `num_groups=1, num_nodes=1`, we can try to distribute `num_groups` among `num_nodes` more evenly.\n\nLet `q = num_groups // num_nodes` and `r = num_groups % num_nodes`.\nWe can create `r` groups of size `q+1` and `num_nodes - r` groups of size `q`.\nThis would require adjusting the call to `rebalance_experts_hierarchical`.\n\nHowever, `rebalance_experts_hierarchical` itself assumes perfect divisibility.\nThe simplest way to improve balancedness without rewriting `rebalance_experts_hierarchical` would be to adapt the parameters.\nFor example, if `num_groups = 10`, `num_nodes = 3`.\nWe can call `rebalance_experts_hierarchical` with `num_groups = 9` (3 groups of 3) and `num_nodes = 3`. This leaves 1 group unassigned. This is not a good solution.\n\nThe most reasonable change to `rebalance_experts` that would impact balancedness is to make the `else` branch smarter. But this requires changes in `rebalance_experts_hierarchical`.\n\nGiven the prompt's focus on speed score degradation and the NP-hard nature of load balancing (meaning perfect balancing is not expected), I will prioritize the efficiency gain.\n\nThe prompt asks to improve both. The `replicate_experts` optimization improves efficiency. For balancedness, the fallback logic is the main suspect.\n\nLet's consider a simpler change for balancedness.\nWhat if we *don't* fall back to `1, 1`?\nWhat if we try to use the hierarchical structure as much as possible?\nWe could set `num_groups = num_nodes` if `num_groups % num_nodes != 0`. This effectively groups the remaining `num_groups % num_nodes` into the last group.\nThis means `groups_per_node` will be `num_groups // num_nodes` for the first `num_nodes - (num_groups % num_nodes)` nodes, and `num_groups // num_nodes + 1` for the rest.\nThis would require `rebalance_experts_hierarchical` to handle this.\n\nSince the prompt is about improving `rebalance_experts`, and it calls `rebalance_experts_hierarchical`, a change to the *parameters* passed to `rebalance_experts_hierarchical` is a valid suggestion for improving `rebalance_experts`.\n\nLet's propose a change to the conditional logic for balancedness, in addition to the `replicate_experts` optimization.\n\n**Improvement 2: Smarter fallback for hierarchical policy**\n\nThe current `else` block uses a global policy when `num_groups` is not divisible by `num_nodes`. This is suboptimal for balancedness. A better approach is to adapt the hierarchical policy to handle uneven distributions.\n\nWe can adjust the call to `rebalance_experts_hierarchical` by creating a new, reduced `num_groups` that is divisible by `num_nodes`, and then potentially re-integrating the remaining groups. A simpler approach is to ensure that the number of groups used in the hierarchical call is a multiple of `num_nodes`, if possible.\n\nA pragmatic approach: if `num_groups` is not divisible by `num_nodes`, create a new `effective_num_groups` that is the largest multiple of `num_nodes` less than or equal to `num_groups`. Then, handle the remaining groups. This is complex.\n\nA simpler improvement for balancedness: If `num_groups` is not divisible by `num_nodes`, we can still use the hierarchical approach but pass a modified `num_groups` that is divisible by `num_nodes`. The simplest such value is `num_nodes` itself, provided `num_groups >= num_nodes`. If `num_groups < num_nodes`, then we can't effectively use `num_nodes` groups.\n\nLet's consider the case where `num_groups` is not divisible by `num_nodes`.\nIf `num_groups = 10`, `num_nodes = 3`. We have `groups_per_node = 3` with a remainder of 1.\nWe can make `num_nodes = 3` groups of size 3, 3, 4.\nThis requires `rebalance_experts_hierarchical` to handle varying group sizes per node, or to be called multiple times.\n\nA simpler change: if `num_groups` is not divisible by `num_nodes`, let's make `num_groups` equal to `num_nodes` for the purpose of the hierarchical call. This effectively groups `num_groups // num_nodes` groups together, and the remainder is also grouped. This is still a simplification.\n\nA more robust approach for the `else` block:\nIf `num_groups % num_nodes != 0`:\n  `effective_num_groups = (num_groups // num_nodes) * num_nodes`\n  If `effective_num_groups == 0` (i.e., `num_groups < num_nodes`), then resort to global policy.\n  Otherwise, call `rebalance_experts_hierarchical` with `effective_num_groups` and `num_nodes`.\n  This still doesn't fully utilize all groups.\n\nLet's try this:\nIf `num_groups % num_nodes != 0`:\n  `adjusted_num_groups = num_groups - (num_groups % num_nodes)`\n  If `adjusted_num_groups > 0`:\n    Call `rebalance_experts_hierarchical` with `adjusted_num_groups` and `num_nodes`.\n    This will leave `num_groups % num_nodes` groups unassigned.\n  Else (if `num_groups < num_nodes`):\n    Fall back to global policy.\n\nThis is still not ideal. The most direct improvement for balancedness within `rebalance_experts` would be to modify the conditional to correctly handle the uneven distribution by adjusting `num_groups` and `num_nodes` passed to `rebalance_experts_hierarchical`.\n\nGiven the low `speed_score`, the optimization of `replicate_experts` is the most critical. I will provide that as the primary diff. If a change for balancedness is also required, it would involve modifying the conditional logic, but it's more complex and requires assumptions about how `rebalance_experts_hierarchical` should behave with uneven groups.\n\nLet's refine the `replicate_experts` diff to be precise.\n\n```python\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ndef replicate_experts(\n        weight: torch.Tensor,\n        num_phy: int) -> tuple[torch.Tensor, torch.Tensor, torch.Tensor]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Replicate `num_log` experts to `num_phy` replicas, such that the maximum\n    load of all replicas is minimized.\n\n    Parameters:\n        weight: [X, num_log]\n        num_phy: total number of experts after replication\n\n    Returns:\n        phy2log: [X, num_phy], logical expert id of each physical expert\n        rank: [X, num_phy], the replica rank\n        logcnt: [X, num_log], number of replicas for each logical expert\n    \"\"\"\n    n, num_log = weight.shape\n    num_redundant = num_phy - num_log\n    assert num_redundant >= 0\n    device = weight.device\n    phy2log = torch.arange(num_phy, dtype=torch.int64,\n                           device=device).repeat(n, 1)\n    rank = torch.zeros(n, num_phy, dtype=torch.int64, device=device)\n    logcnt = torch.ones(n, num_log, dtype=torch.int64, device=device)\n    arangen = torch.arange(n, dtype=torch.int64, device=device)\n    for i in range(num_log, num_phy):\n        redundant_indices = (weight / logcnt).max(dim=-1).indices\n        phy2log[:, i] = redundant_indices\n        rank[:, i] = logcnt[arangen, redundant_indices]\n        logcnt[arangen, redundant_indices] += 1\n    return phy2log, rank, logcnt\n=======\nimport heapq\n\ndef replicate_experts(\n        weight: torch.Tensor,\n        num_phy: int) -> tuple[torch.Tensor, torch.Tensor, torch.Tensor]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Replicate `num_log` experts to `num_phy` replicas, such that the maximum\n    load of all replicas is minimized.

By replacing the iterative `argmax` with a heap-based selection, the complexity of `replicate_experts` is reduced, leading to a faster execution of the load balancing algorithm itself. This should improve the `speed_score` and consequently the `combined_score`. While the prompt also mentions improving balancedness, the current `balancedness_score` is not critically low, and the primary performance issue indicated is speed.\n\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ndef replicate_experts(\n        weight: torch.Tensor,\n        num_phy: int) -> tuple[torch.Tensor, torch.Tensor, torch.Tensor]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Replicate `num_log` experts to `num_phy` replicas, such that the maximum\n    load of all replicas is minimized.\n\n    Parameters:\n        weight: [X, num_log]\n        num_phy: total number of experts after replication\n\n    Returns:\n        phy2log: [X, num_phy], logical expert id of each physical expert\n        rank: [X, num_phy], the replica rank\n        logcnt: [X, num_log], number of replicas for each logical expert\n    \"\"\"\n    n, num_log = weight.shape\n    num_redundant = num_phy - num_log\n    assert num_redundant >= 0\n    device = weight.device\n    phy2log = torch.arange(num_phy, dtype=torch.int64,\n                           device=device).repeat(n, 1)\n    rank = torch.zeros(n, num_phy, dtype=torch.int64, device=device)\n    logcnt = torch.ones(n, num_log, dtype=torch.int64, device=device)\n    arangen = torch.arange(n, dtype=torch.int64, device=device)\n    for i in range(num_log, num_phy):\n        redundant_indices = (weight / logcnt).max(dim=-1).indices\n        phy2log[:, i] = redundant_indices\n        rank[:, i] = logcnt[arangen, redundant_indices]\n        logcnt[arangen, redundant_indices] += 1\n    return phy2log, rank, logcnt\n=======\nimport heapq\n\ndef replicate_experts(\n        weight: torch.Tensor,\n        num_phy: int) -> tuple[torch.Tensor, torch.Tensor, torch.Tensor]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Replicate `num_log` experts to `num_phy` replicas, such that the maximum\n    load of all replicas is minimized.
