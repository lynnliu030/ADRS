This error must be addressed first. Additionally, the `balanced_packing` function can be optimized for efficiency.\n\n**Analysis of the Error (`index 8460 is out of bounds for dimension 1 with size 8448`):**\n\nThe error occurs in the `rebalance_experts` function during the `log2phy.view(...).scatter_` operation.\nThe `log2phy` tensor is initialized with dimensions `(num_layers, num_logical_experts, maxlogcnt)`.\nThe `scatter_` operation flattens the last two dimensions, so the effective size of the second dimension becomes `num_logical_experts * maxlogcnt`.\nThe index used for `scatter_` is `phy2log * maxlogcnt + phyrank`.\n\nLet's trace the values:\n*   `phy2log`: Contains logical expert IDs, ranging from `0` to `num_logical_experts - 1`. Its shape is `[layers, num_replicas]`.\n*   `phyrank`: Contains the 0-indexed replica rank for each physical expert. Its shape is `[layers, num_replicas]`.\n*   Crucially, `replicate_experts` assigns `phyrank` values that can range from `0` up to `num_phy - 1` (where `num_phy` is `num_replicas`). This means a single logical expert could theoretically receive all `num_replicas` physical experts, leading to `phyrank` values up to `num_replicas - 1`.\n*   `maxlogcnt` is calculated as `num_redundant_experts + 1 = (num_replicas - num_logical_experts) + 1`.\n\nThe problem arises when `phyrank` (which can be up to `num_replicas - 1`) is greater than or equal to `maxlogcnt`.\nIf `phyrank` is `X`, and `maxlogcnt` is `M`, the index for `scatter_` is `logical_expert_id * M + X`.\nIf `X >= M`, this index can exceed the bounds of the `M` dimension for a given `logical_expert_id`.\nSpecifically, if `X = M`, the index becomes `logical_expert_id * M + M = (logical_expert_id + 1) * M`. If `logical_expert_id` is `num_logical_experts - 1`, this becomes `num_logical_experts * M`, which is precisely one past the end of the flattened dimension of size `num_logical_experts * M`.\n\nTo fix this, `maxlogcnt` (the third dimension of `log2phy`) must be large enough to accommodate the maximum possible `phyrank`. Since `phyrank` can go up to `num_replicas - 1`, `maxlogcnt` should be set to `num_replicas`.\n\n**Optimization of `balanced_packing`:**\n\nThe current `balanced_packing` function contains a nested loop where `temp_pack_weights = current_pack_weights.clone()` and `torch.argmin` are called repeatedly (`num_layers * num_groups` times).\n*   `current_pack_weights.clone()` creates a new tensor copy in each inner iteration.\n*   `torch.argmin` on CPU can be relatively slow, especially when performed many times on small tensors.\n\nThis pattern can be optimized by using a min-heap, similar to how `replicate_experts` is implemented. A min-heap allows for `O(log K)` (where K is `num_packs`) retrieval of the minimum element, as opposed to `O(K)` for `argmin`. This avoids repeated tensor cloning and potentially speeds up the packing process, especially when `num_packs` is large. The greedy LPT (Longest Processing Time) heuristic for bin packing, which the original code implements, can be efficiently replicated using a min-heap.\n\n**Proposed Changes:**\n\n1.  **Fix `index out of bounds` error in `rebalance_experts`:**\n    Change the calculation of `maxlogcnt` to `num_replicas`. This ensures `log2phy` is correctly sized to hold all possible replica mappings.\n\n2.  **Optimize `balanced_packing`:**\n    Refactor the inner loop to use a `heapq` (min-heap) to efficiently find the pack with the minimum current weight. This replaces the `clone()` and `argmin` calls, leading to better performance.\n\n```diff\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    # Initialize pack_index and rank_in_pack.\n    # These will be fully populated, so `empty_like` is sufficient.\n    # They will be on the same device as 'weight' (i.e., CPU).\n    pack_index = torch.empty_like(weight, dtype=torch.int64)\n    rank_in_pack = torch.empty_like(pack_index)\n    \n    # Initialize tensors to hold pack weights and item counts for all layers.\n    # These tensors are on the same device as 'weight' (which is CPU).\n    pack_weights_per_layer = torch.zeros(\n        num_layers, num_packs, dtype=weight.dtype, device=weight.device)\n    pack_items_per_layer = torch.zeros(\n        num_layers, num_packs, dtype=torch.int64, device=weight.device)\n\n    # Iterate over each layer.
