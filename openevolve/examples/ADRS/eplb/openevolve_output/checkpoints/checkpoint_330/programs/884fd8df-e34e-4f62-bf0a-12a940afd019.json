The primary area for improvement identified is the efficiency of the `balanced_packing` function, which contains nested Python loops that can hinder performance, especially for larger input sizes.\n\nThe `balanced_packing` function uses a greedy approach (Longest Processing Time heuristic) to assign experts to packs. While this approach is effective for load balancing, its current implementation iterates through each MoE layer (`num_layers`) using a Python `for` loop. Inside this loop, it further iterates through sorted expert groups to assign them to the least loaded pack. The operations within the inner loop are mostly vectorized PyTorch operations, but the outer Python loop prevents these layer-wise operations from being efficiently batched or compiled by PyTorch's backend.\n\nMy proposed improvement focuses on vectorizing the `balanced_packing` function across the `num_layers` dimension using `torch.vmap`. This allows the per-layer packing logic to be executed in parallel by PyTorch's optimized C++/CUDA kernels, significantly reducing the overhead of Python loops.\n\n**Detailed Plan and Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Introduce a Helper Function (`_pack_single_layer`):**\n    *   Extract the core logic for packing a *single* MoE layer into a new private helper function, `_pack_single_layer`. This function will take a 1D tensor representing the weights for one layer, `num_packs`, and `groups_per_pack`.\n    *   This helper function will contain the existing greedy assignment loop, but it will operate on a single layer's data.\n\n2.  **Utilize `torch.vmap` in `balanced_packing`:**\n    *   In the `balanced_packing` function, instead of iterating `for i in range(num_layers)`, call `torch.vmap` on the new `_pack_single_layer` helper.\n    *   `vmap` will automatically parallelize the execution of `_pack_single_layer` across the `num_layers` dimension of the input `weight` tensor. This effectively moves the loop from Python to a more efficient backend.\n    *   The `in_dims=(0, None, None)` argument to `vmap` tells it to map over the first dimension (layers) of `weight`, while `num_packs` and `groups_per_pack` remain constant across all mapped calls.\n\n3.  **Micro-optimization within `_pack_single_layer`:**\n    *   Replace `torch.full_like(current_pack_weights, float('inf'))` with a direct `float('inf')` in the `torch.argmin(torch.where(...))` call. `torch.where` supports scalar broadcasting, so creating a full tensor of infinities in each iteration is unnecessary and can be a minor source of overhead.\n\n**Expected Impact:**\n\n*   **`speed_score` Improvement:** This is the primary target. By replacing the explicit Python loop over layers with `torch.vmap`, the computation will be significantly faster, especially for models with many MoE layers.\n*   **`balancedness_score`:** The core greedy algorithm for load balancing remains unchanged, so the `balancedness_score` should be preserved or remain very similar.\n*   **`combined_score`:** With a substantial improvement in `speed_score` and maintained `balancedness_score`, the `combined_score` is expected to increase.\n*   **Readability and Maintainability:** While introducing a helper function adds a few lines, it arguably improves clarity by separating the per-layer logic from the batching mechanism. `vmap` is a standard and powerful PyTorch tool for performance.\n\n**Proposed Changes (Diff Format):**\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nimport torch\n\n\ndef balanced_packing(weight: torch.Tensor,\n                     num_packs: int) -> tuple[torch.Tensor, torch.Tensor]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Pack n weighted objects to m packs, such that each bin contains exactly\n    n/m objects and the weights of all packs are as balanced as possible.\n\n    Parameters:\n        weight: [X, n], the weight of each item\n        num_packs: number of packs\n\n    Returns:\n        pack_index: [X, n], the pack index of each item\n        rank_in_pack: [X, n], the rank of the item in the pack\n    \"\"\"\n    num_layers, num_groups = weight.shape\n    assert num_groups % num_packs == 0\n    groups_per_pack = num_groups // num_packs\n\n    if groups_per_pack == 1:\n        pack_index = torch.arange(weight.size(-1),\n                                  dtype=torch.int64,\n                                  device=weight.device).expand(weight.shape)\n        rank_in_pack = torch.zeros_like(weight, dtype=torch.int64)\n        return pack_index, rank_in_pack\n\n    # Sort groups by weight in descending order.\n    # 'weight' is already float and on CPU from rebalance_experts,\n    # so no need for .float().cpu() here.\n    indices = weight.sort(-1, descending=True).indices\n\n    # Initialize pack_index and rank_in_pack.\n    # These will be fully populated, so `empty_like` is sufficient.\n    # They will be on the same device as 'weight' (i.e., CPU).\n    pack_index = torch.empty_like(weight, dtype=torch.int64)\n    rank_in_pack = torch.empty_like(pack_index)\n    \n    # Initialize tensors to hold pack weights and item counts for all layers.\n    # These tensors are on the same device as 'weight' (which is CPU).\n    pack_weights_per_layer = torch.zeros(\n        num_layers, num_packs, dtype=weight.dtype, device=weight.device)\n    pack_items_per_layer = torch.zeros(\n        num_layers, num_packs, dtype=torch.int64, device=weight.device)\n\n    # Iterate over each layer.
