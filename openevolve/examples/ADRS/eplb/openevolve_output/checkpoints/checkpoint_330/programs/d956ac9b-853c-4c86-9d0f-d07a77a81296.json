The primary goal is to improve these metrics.\n\nThe `balanced_packing` function appears to be a key area for optimization. It implements a greedy assignment strategy where items (expert groups) are assigned to the pack (GPU/node) with the minimum current load. While the greedy strategy itself is a common heuristic and unlikely to be the cause of regression in balancedness (unless there's a subtle bug), its implementation can significantly impact execution speed.\n\n**Identified Bottlenecks in `balanced_packing`:**\n\n1.  **Repeated `torch.where` and `available_pack_indices` recomputation:** Inside the inner loop (`for group_idx_in_sorted_list`), the code repeatedly computes `not_full_mask` and `available_pack_indices` using `torch.where`. `torch.where` creates new tensors and these operations are relatively expensive when performed in a tight loop for each item assignment.\n2.  **`group_id.item()` call:** Accessing a tensor element as a Python scalar using `.item()` can be inefficient, especially if the tensor is on a GPU, as it often involves a synchronization step between CPU and GPU. PyTorch generally handles 0-dimensional tensor indexing efficiently without requiring `.item()`.\n\n**Proposed Improvements:**\n\nThe core idea is to optimize the selection of the \"least loaded\" pack. Instead of maintaining a list of \"available\" packs and then finding the minimum among them, we can use a single tensor that represents the current load of each pack, and mark full packs by setting their load to `float('inf')`. This allows `torch.argmin` to always find an available (not full) pack with the minimum load in a single, efficient tensor operation.\n\n**Detailed Changes:**\n\nThe modifications are focused on the inner loop of the `balanced_packing` function, specifically replacing the logic that manages `available_pack_indices`.\n\n1.  **Eliminate `available_pack_indices` and `not_full_mask` recomputation:** Introduce a `pack_weights_for_selection` tensor, initialized with current pack weights. When a pack becomes full, set its corresponding value in `pack_weights_for_selection` to `float('inf')`. This way, `torch.argmin(pack_weights_for_selection)` will always correctly identify the least loaded *available* pack.\n2.  **Remove `.item()`:** Use the 0-dimensional tensor `group_id` directly for indexing `pack_index`, `rank_in_pack`, and `weight`.\n\nThese changes are expected to significantly improve the `speed_score` by reducing Python overhead, tensor creation, and redundant computations within the most frequently executed part of the algorithm. The `balancedness_score` should not be negatively impacted as the underlying greedy heuristic remains the same; it might even slightly improve if the previous implementation had subtle numerical or indexing issues due to its complexity.\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        # Create a mask for packs that are not yet full.\n        not_full_mask = current_pack_items < groups_per_pack\n        \n        # Find the indices of available packs.\n        available_pack_indices = torch.where(not_full_mask)[0]\n        \n        # If all packs are full, this should not happen given the problem constraints.\n        # Asserting this for debugging.\n        assert torch.any(not_full_mask), \"All packs are full, but we are still assigning items.\"\n\n        # Iterate through the group IDs sorted by weight.\n        for group_idx_in_sorted_list in range(num_groups):\n            # Get the actual group ID from the sorted indices.\n            group_id = layer_indices[group_idx_in_sorted_list].item()\n\n            # Get the weights corresponding to these available pack indices.\n            weights_of_available_packs = current_pack_weights[available_pack_indices]\n            \n            # Find the index within the `available_pack_indices` tensor that corresponds to the minimum weight.\n            best_available_idx = torch.argmin(weights_of_available_packs)\n            \n            # Get the actual pack index (the original index in the `num_packs` dimension).\n            pack = available_pack_indices[best_available_idx]\n\n            # Assign the group to the chosen pack.\n            # The `group_id` is the column index for the `pack_index` and `rank_in_pack` tensors.\n            pack_index[i, group_id] = pack\n            rank_in_pack[i, group_id] = current_pack_items[pack]\n\n            # Update pack weights and item counts for the chosen pack.\n            current_pack_weights[pack] += weight[i, group_id]\n            current_pack_items[pack] += 1\n\n            # After assigning an item to a pack, we need to update the `not_full_mask` and `available_pack_indices`\n            # for the next iteration.
