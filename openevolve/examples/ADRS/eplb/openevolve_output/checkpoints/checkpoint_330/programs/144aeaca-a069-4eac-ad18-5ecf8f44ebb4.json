The historical data indicates a decline in performance across all metrics from previous attempts. Specifically, the `balancedness_score` has regressed from 0.3528 to 0.2983, and `speed_score` from 0.1097 to 0.0270. This suggests that recent changes may have introduced inefficiencies or suboptimal balancing strategies.\n\nThe core of the algorithm lies in `rebalance_experts_hierarchical` and the helper functions `balanced_packing` and `replicate_experts`. The hierarchical approach attempts to leverage network topology (nodes and GPUs) for faster intra-node communication. However, the current implementation might be overly complex or not optimally mapping experts to this topology.\n\nHere are a few suggestions to improve both balancedness and speed:\n\n### Improvement 1: Simplify Hierarchical Logic and Focus on Global Balancing when Hierarchical Constraints are Not Met\n\nThe current code has a conditional:\n```python\n    if num_groups % num_nodes == 0:\n        # use hierarchical load-balance policy\n        phy2log, phyrank, logcnt = rebalance_experts_hierarchical(\n            weight, num_replicas, num_groups, num_nodes, num_gpus)\n    else:\n        # use global load-balance policy\n        phy2log, phyrank, logcnt = rebalance_experts_hierarchical(\n            weight, num_replicas, 1, 1, num_gpus)\n```\nThis `else` block calls `rebalance_experts_hierarchical` with `num_groups=1`, `num_nodes=1`. This effectively turns the hierarchical function into a global one. However, the internal logic of `rebalance_experts_hierarchical` is still structured around the assumptions of `num_groups` and `num_nodes`. This might lead to inefficiencies or suboptimal results when the hierarchical constraints aren't met.\n\nA more direct approach would be to have a dedicated `rebalance_experts_global` function or to simplify the conditional to directly call a global balancing strategy when `num_groups % num_nodes != 0`. This could reduce code complexity and potentially improve performance by avoiding unnecessary hierarchical calculations.\n\nGiven the performance regressions, it's possible that the hierarchical logic itself is not yielding the expected benefits or is introducing overhead. Focusing on a robust global balancing strategy when the hierarchical conditions aren't ideal might be a good first step.\n\nLet's refine the `rebalance_experts` function to use a clearer separation between hierarchical and global balancing.\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    if num_groups % num_nodes == 0:\n        # use hierarchical load-balance policy\n        phy2log, phyrank, logcnt = rebalance_experts_hierarchical(\n            weight, num_replicas, num_groups, num_nodes, num_gpus)\n    else:\n        # use global load-balance policy\n        phy2log, phyrank, logcnt = rebalance_experts_hierarchical(\n            weight, num_replicas, 1, 1, num_gpus)\n    num_redundant_experts = num_replicas - num_logical_experts\n    maxlogcnt = num_redundant_experts + 1\n    log2phy: torch.Tensor = torch.full(\n        (num_layers, num_logical_experts, maxlogcnt),\n        -1,\n        dtype=torch.int64,\n        device=logcnt.device,\n    )\n    log2phy.view(num_layers, -1).scatter_(\n        -1,\n        phy2log * maxlogcnt + phyrank,\n        torch.arange(num_replicas, dtype=torch.int64,\n                     device=log2phy.device).expand(num_layers, -1),\n    )\n    return phy2log, log2phy, logcnt\n=======\n    # Determine the balancing strategy based on network topology constraints\n    if num_groups % num_nodes == 0 and num_nodes > 1:\n        # Use hierarchical load-balance policy if groups can be evenly distributed across nodes\n        # and there's more than one node to leverage the hierarchy.\n        phy2log, phyrank, logcnt = rebalance_experts_hierarchical(\n            weight, num_replicas, num_groups, num_nodes, num_gpus)\n    else:\n        # Use global load-balance policy if hierarchical constraints are not met\n        # or if there's only one node, making hierarchy irrelevant.\n        # We can reuse the hierarchical function by setting num_groups=1 and num_nodes=1\n        # to simulate a global balancing scenario.

Its efficiency directly impacts the overall speed.\nThe current implementation uses `torch.argmin` within a loop to find the best pack. This can be a bottleneck.\n\nOne potential optimization is to use a more efficient method for finding the minimum, especially if `num_packs` is large. For example, using `torch.topk` or a specialized selection algorithm might offer performance gains. However, given the constraint of not changing the core logic drastically, let's focus on a more direct optimization within the existing loop structure.\n\nThe line:\n`pack = torch.argmin(torch.where(current_pack_items == groups_per_pack, float('inf'), current_pack_weights)).item()`\nThis line creates a temporary tensor with `inf` values for full packs. While concise, it might involve overhead.\n\nA slight optimization could be to maintain a list of available packs and pick from them, or to use `torch.multinomial` if we were sampling, but here we need the minimum.\nLet's stick to optimizing the current approach.\n\nConsider pre-sorting the packs by their current weights. However, this would require re-sorting in each iteration of the inner loop, which might be more expensive.\n\nLet's re-examine the loop:\n```python\n    for i in range(num_layers):\n        for group_id in indices[i]:\n            # ...\n            pack = torch.argmin(\n                torch.where(current_pack_items == groups_per_pack,\n                            float('inf'),  # Set full packs to infinity\n                            current_pack_weights)).item()\n            # ...\n```\nThe `current_pack_items == groups_per_pack` check is performed for every `group_id` within a layer. This can be made more efficient. Instead of creating a masked tensor every time, we can track available packs.\n\nHowever, a simpler optimization that might yield benefits without drastically changing the structure:\nThe `torch.where` and `torch.argmin` combination is generally efficient for finding the index of the minimum element in a tensor, especially when dealing with conditions. The main cost is likely the repeated calls within the inner loop.\n\nLet's consider how `torch.topk` could be used. `torch.topk(current_pack_weights, k=1, largest=False)` would give the minimum. If we need to handle full packs, we'd still need a masking mechanism.\n\nLet's focus on a micro-optimization within `balanced_packing` that might reduce some overhead.\n\nThe current implementation:\n```python\n    # Initialize tensors to hold pack weights and item counts for all layers.\n    # These tensors are on the same device as 'weight' (which is CPU).\n    pack_weights_per_layer = torch.zeros(\n        num_layers, num_packs, dtype=weight.dtype, device=weight.device)\n    pack_items_per_layer = torch.zeros(\n        num_layers, num_packs, dtype=torch.int64, device=weight.device)\n\n    # Iterate over each layer. The greedy assignment per layer is sequential.\n    for i in range(num_layers):\n        # For each layer, process groups in sorted order of their weights.\n        # `indices[i]` is a 1D tensor of group IDs for the current layer.\n        for group_id in indices[i]:\n            # Get current state for this layer's packs.\n            current_pack_weights = pack_weights_per_layer[i]\n            current_pack_items = pack_items_per_layer[i]\n            \n            # ... find pack ...\n```\nThe `current_pack_weights = pack_weights_per_layer[i]` and `current_pack_items = pack_items_per_layer[i]` lines create views. This is generally fine. The main concern is the `torch.argmin(torch.where(...))` inside the inner loop.\n\nIf `num_packs` is small, this might be acceptable. If `num_packs` can be large, this becomes a concern.\nThe prompt mentions improving efficiency. The current `balanced_packing` is O(num_layers * num_groups * num_packs).\n\nLet's consider a scenario where `num_groups` is large and `num_packs` is also large.\nThe prompt also states \"Consider simplifying the code to improve readability and maintainability.\" The current code is quite dense.\n\nLet's focus on a change that *might* improve speed without fundamentally altering the algorithm's nature, and also potentially improve readability.\n\nThe `balanced_packing` function could be slightly refactored to avoid repeated indexing into `pack_weights_per_layer` and `pack_items_per_layer` within the inner loop.\n\nConsider this part:\n```python\n            # Get current state for this layer's packs.\n            current_pack_weights = pack_weights_per_layer[i]\n            current_pack_items = pack_items_per_layer[i]\n\n            # Find the pack with the minimum current weight among available ones.\n            # Use torch.where to set weights of full packs to infinity without cloning,\n            # which can be slightly more efficient and concise.\n            pack = torch.argmin(\n                torch.where(current_pack_items == groups_per_pack,\n                            float('inf'),  # Set full packs to infinity\n                            current_pack_weights)).item()\n\n            # Assert that a valid pack was found and it has space.\n            assert current_pack_items[pack] < groups_per_pack\n\n            # Assign the group to the chosen pack.\n            # `group_id` is a 0-dim tensor, which can be directly used for indexing.\n            pack_index[i, group_id] = pack\n            rank_in_pack[i, group_id] = current_pack_items[pack]\n\n            # Update pack weights and item counts for the chosen pack.\n            # `weight[i, group_id]` is the weight of the current group.\n            pack_weights_per_layer[i, pack] += weight[i, group_id]\n            pack_items_per_layer[i, pack] += 1\n```\n\nInstead of getting `current_pack_weights` and `current_pack_items` as separate variables, we can directly operate on the slices.\n\nHowever, the most significant performance bottleneck is likely the `torch.argmin(torch.where(...))` inside the innermost loop.\nIf `num_packs` is large, this is inefficient.\n\nLet's consider a change that could improve the speed of `balanced_packing` by using `torch.topk` more effectively.\nThe goal is to find the pack `p` that minimizes `current_pack_weights[p]` subject to `current_pack_items[p] < groups_per_pack`.\n\nWe can achieve this by:\n1. Masking `current_pack_weights` where `current_pack_items == groups_per_pack` to infinity.\n2. Then finding the minimum of the masked weights.\n\nThis is exactly what `torch.where` does. The issue is the repeated call.\n\nAn alternative:\nInstead of iterating through `group_id` in sorted order, we could iterate through packs and assign groups. But that's not how this greedy algorithm works.\n\nLet's focus on making the selection of the best pack faster.\nIf `num_packs` is large, we could consider a min-heap. But that adds complexity.\n\nA simpler approach might be to use `torch.topk` to get the indices of the smallest elements. If the `k` smallest elements are all in full packs, we need to look further.\n\nLet's try to optimize the selection of `pack` without introducing a heap.\nThe current approach is O(num_layers * num_groups * num_packs).\n\nA potential speed improvement could come from using `torch.min` with a mask, but `torch.argmin` is already doing that.\n\nConsider the possibility that the \"regression\" in speed score indicates that the current implementation of `rebalance_experts_hierarchical` is indeed the culprit. The logic within `rebalance_experts_hierarchical` is quite complex and involves multiple `gather`, `view`, `flatten`, `unflatten`, and `inverse` operations.\n\nLet's revisit the `balanced_packing` function.\nThe line:\n`pack = torch.argmin(torch.where(current_pack_items == groups_per_pack, float('inf'), current_pack_weights)).item()`\nThis is done `num_layers * num_groups` times.\n`num_groups` is `num_logical_experts // group_size`.\n\nIf `num_groups` is large, this is costly.\n\nWhat if we try to optimize the `replicate_experts` function as well?\nThe `replicate_experts` function:\n```python\n    for i in range(num_log, num_phy):\n        redundant_indices = (weight / logcnt).max(dim=-1).indices\n        phy2log[:, i] = redundant_indices\n        rank[:, i] = logcnt[arangen, redundant_indices]\n        logcnt[arangen, redundant_indices] += 1\n```\nThis loop runs `num_phy - num_log` times. Inside the loop, `max(dim=-1)` is O(num_log).\nThe total complexity of `replicate_experts` is O((num_phy - num_log) * num_log).\n\nIf `num_phy` is much larger than `num_log`, this can be slow.\nThe problem states \"reduce the execution time of the algorithm itself\".\n\nThe `replicate_experts` function aims to minimize the maximum load of all replicas. This is a variation of the multiway number partitioning problem, which is NP-hard. The current implementation uses a greedy approach: in each step, it replicates the logical expert that, when assigned the next replica, results in the smallest increase in its load (or rather, the smallest load after division by `logcnt`).\n\nThe division `weight / logcnt` calculates the \"average load\" if the next replica is assigned. Then `max(dim=-1).indices` finds the logical expert whose current `logcnt` is such that assigning one more replica to it results in the highest *average* load. This seems counter-intuitive.\n\nLet's re-read: \"such that the maximum load of all replicas is minimized.\"\nThe greedy strategy should probably pick the logical expert that, when receiving one more replica, results in the *smallest* increase in its current load (or smallest absolute load if that's easier to track).\n\nThe current code: `(weight / logcnt).max(dim=-1).indices`\nThis finds the logical expert `j` that maximizes `weight[i, j] / logcnt[i, j]`. This means it's picking the expert that is currently \"most loaded per replica\". This is a common greedy strategy for load balancing (e.g., LPT rule for scheduling).\n\nLet's consider the performance metric `speed_score: 0.0270`. This is very low.\nThe changes that led to the current program likely introduced significant overhead.\n\nOne possible issue is the repeated creation of tensors and the extensive use of tensor operations within loops.\n\nLet's look at `rebalance_experts_hierarchical` again.\nThe line `tokens_per_group = weight.unflatten(-1, (num_groups, group_size)).sum(-1)` is fine.\nThe call to `balanced_packing` is fine.\n`log2mlog = (((group_pack_index * groups_per_node + group_rank_in_pack) * group_size).unsqueeze(-1) + torch.arange(group_size, dtype=torch.int64, device=group_pack_index.device)).flatten(-2)`\nThis line is complex and creates many intermediate tensors.\n\nLet's focus on simplifying `rebalance_experts_hierarchical` itself, and making `balanced_packing` more efficient.\n\nFor `balanced_packing`, the core operation is finding the least loaded pack among those that are not full.\nThe current line:\n`pack = torch.argmin(torch.where(current_pack_items == groups_per_pack, float('inf'), current_pack_weights)).item()`\n\nIf `num_packs` is large, this search is O(num_packs).\nIf we can reduce this to O(log num_packs) or O(1) on average, it would be a significant speedup.\n\nA simple optimization for `balanced_packing`:\nInstead of `torch.where` then `torch.argmin`, we can try to get the indices of available packs and then find the minimum among them.\n\n```python\n    # ... inside the loop for group_id ...\n    \n    # Find available packs (those not yet full)\n    available_packs_mask = current_pack_items < groups_per_pack\n    \n    # If no packs are available (should not happen if logic is correct and groups_per_pack > 0)\n    if not available_packs_mask.any():\n        # This case should ideally not be reached if groups_per_pack >= 1\n        # and num_groups is a multiple of num_packs.\n        # If it does, it indicates an issue with the logic or input constraints.\n        raise RuntimeError(\"No available packs found in balanced_packing.\")\n\n    # Get the weights of available packs\n    available_pack_weights = current_pack_weights[available_packs_mask]\n    \n    # Find the index of the minimum weight among available packs\n    # This index is relative to the `available_pack_weights` tensor.\n    min_weight_idx_in_available = torch.argmin(available_pack_weights).item()\n    \n    # Get the actual pack index by mapping back from the available packs.\n    # We need the indices of the available packs themselves.\n    available_pack_indices = torch.where(available_packs_mask)[0]\n    pack = available_pack_indices[min_weight_idx_in_available].item()\n\n    # ... rest of the assignments ...\n```\nThis approach is conceptually the same but might have slightly different performance characteristics. It explicitly separates the masking and the argmin. The `torch.where(available_packs_mask)[0]` might be costly if called repeatedly.\n\nLet's consider the original `torch.where` approach. It's generally optimized. The issue is the number of calls.\n\nA potential improvement to `balanced_packing` would be to avoid creating `current_pack_weights` and `current_pack_items` views inside the inner loop.\n\n```python\n# Original block\n            current_pack_weights = pack_weights_per_layer[i]\n            current_pack_items = pack_items_per_layer[i]\n\n            pack = torch.argmin(\n                torch.where(current_pack_items == groups_per_pack,\n                            float('inf'),  # Set full packs to infinity\n                            current_pack_weights)).item()\n```\nThis can be rewritten to operate directly on the slices without creating intermediate variables:\n```python\n# Optimized block\n            # Directly operate on the slices to find the best pack\n            # This avoids creating intermediate `current_pack_weights` and `current_pack_items` variables\n            # which might offer a minor performance improvement by reducing Python object creation.\n            pack = torch.argmin(\n                torch.where(pack_items_per_layer[i] == groups_per_pack,\n                            float('inf'),\n                            pack_weights_per_layer[i])).item()\n\n            # Assert that a valid pack was found and it has space.\n            assert pack_items_per_layer[i, pack] < groups_per_pack\n\n            # Assign the group to the chosen pack.\n            pack_index[i, group_id] = pack\n            rank_in_pack[i, group_id] = pack_items_per_layer[i, pack]\n\n            # Update pack weights and item counts for the chosen pack.\n            pack_weights_per_layer[i, pack] += weight[i, group_id]\n            pack_items_per_layer[i, pack] += 1\n```\nThis change is minor but targets the inner loop of `balanced_packing` for potential efficiency gains by reducing Python-level operations.\n\nLet's also consider the overall structure and readability. The `rebalance_experts_hierarchical` function is quite long and complex. Breaking it down or simplifying some of the tensor manipulations could improve maintainability and potentially reveal performance bottlenecks.\n\nHowever, the prompt asks for specific SEARCH/REPLACE. The most impactful changes would be to address the low `speed_score`. The `balanced_packing` function is a prime candidate.\n\nThe current `balanced_packing` is O(N*M*P) where N=num_layers, M=num_groups, P=num_packs.\nThe dominant factor is often `P`.\nIf `num_packs` is large, `torch.argmin(torch.where(...))` is O(P).\n\nLet's try to optimize `balanced_packing` by using `torch.topk` to find the best pack more efficiently.\n\n```python\n# Inside the loop for group_id in indices[i]:\n            # Get the weights and item counts for all packs in the current layer\n            layer_weights = pack_weights_per_layer[i]\n            layer_items = pack_items_per_layer[i]\n\n            # Create a mask for packs that are not yet full\n            available_mask = layer_items < groups_per_pack\n\n            # Apply infinity to weights of full packs\n            # Use a large number instead of float('inf') to avoid potential issues\n            # with operations on infinity, though torch.where handles it well.\n            # Using a very large number might be slightly faster if it avoids\n            # special float handling. Let's stick to float('inf') for correctness.\n            masked_weights = torch.where(available_mask, layer_weights, torch.finfo(layer_weights.dtype).max)\n\n            # Find the index of the minimum weight among available packs.\n            # torch.min returns (values, indices). We need the index.\n            min_weight_val, pack = torch.min(masked_weights, dim=-1)\n            \n            # The value `pack` is now the index of the least loaded available pack.\n            # No need for .item() here yet, as it will be used to index.\n            pack = pack.item() # Convert to scalar for assignment\n\n            # Rest of the code remains the same, but uses the `pack` index.\n            # ...\n```\nThis change replaces `torch.argmin(torch.where(...))` with `torch.where(...)` followed by `torch.min(..., dim=-1)`. This is functionally equivalent but might have different performance characteristics. The `torch.min` with `dim=-1` is often well-optimized.\n\nLet's consider the overall complexity and the regression. The regression in `speed_score` from 0.1097 to 0.0270 is substantial. This suggests that either the logic introduced in the recent changes is computationally expensive, or it's not efficiently implemented.\n\nThe `rebalance_experts_hierarchical` function performs several complex tensor operations.\nThe line:\n`pphy2mlog = phy2mlog.gather(-1, pphy2phy).view(num_layers, -1)`\nand subsequent operations involving `view`, `arange`, `flatten` are where significant overhead might be introduced.\n\nGiven the instruction to \"improve the algorithm to be more efficient\", let's focus on `balanced_packing` as it's a core component called multiple times.\n\nThe change using `torch.min` instead of `torch.argmin(torch.where(...))` is a good candidate for a targeted improvement.\n\nLet's also reconsider the conditional logic in `rebalance_experts`.\nThe `else` branch calls `rebalance_experts_hierarchical` with `num_groups=1, num_nodes=1`. This is a valid way to force global balancing. However, the internal logic of `rebalance_experts_hierarchical` is designed for a hierarchical structure. It might be more efficient to have a dedicated global balancing function.\n\nHowever, the prompt also states \"Consider simplifying the code to improve readability and maintainability\". The current `else` branch is a form of code reuse, which aids maintainability.\n\nLet's focus on the `balanced_packing` function for speed.\nThe change to use `torch.min` directly on masked weights is a plausible optimization.\n\nFinal proposed change for `balanced_packing`:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n            # Find the pack with the minimum current weight among available ones.\n            # Use torch.where to set weights of full packs to infinity without cloning,\n            # which can be slightly more efficient and concise.\n            pack = torch.argmin(\n                torch.where(current_pack_items == groups_per_pack,\n                            float('inf'),  # Set full packs to infinity\n                            current_pack_weights)).item()\n\n            # Assert that a valid pack was found and it has space.\n            assert current_pack_items[pack] < groups_per_pack\n\n            # Assign the group to the chosen pack.\n            # `group_id` is a 0-dim tensor, which can be directly used for indexing.\n            pack_index[i, group_id] = pack\n            rank_in_pack[i, group_id] = current_pack_items[pack]\n\n            # Update pack weights and item counts for the chosen pack.\n            # `weight[i, group_id]` is the weight of the current group.\n            pack_weights_per_layer[i, pack] += weight[i, group_id]\n            pack_items_per_layer[i, pack] += 1\n=======\n            # Get the weights and item counts for all packs in the current layer\n            layer_weights = pack_weights_per_layer[i]\n            layer_items = pack_items_per_layer[i]\n\n            # Create a mask for packs that are not yet full\n            available_mask = layer_items < groups_per_pack\n\n            # Apply a very large value (effectively infinity) to weights of full packs.\n            # This allows us to use torch.min to find the least loaded available pack.\n            # Using torch.finfo(layer_weights.dtype).max is safer than float('inf')\n            # for certain operations, though torch.where handles it well.\n            masked_weights = torch.where(available_mask, layer_weights, torch.finfo(layer_weights.dtype).max)\n\n            # Find the index of the minimum weight among available packs.\n            # torch.min returns (values, indices).

This is a common pattern and might be better optimized by PyTorch than the `torch.argmin(torch.where(...))` combination, especially in a tight loop. It also slightly improves readability by making the intention clearer.\n\nThe previous regression in `speed_score` suggests that the current implementation of `rebalance_experts_hierarchical` might be too complex or contain inefficient tensor operations. However, without seeing the exact changes that led to the regression, it's hard to pinpoint. The `balanced_packing` function is a good candidate for optimization as it's called multiple times.\n\nRegarding the `balancedness_score` regression, that's harder to address without understanding the specific algorithm changes. The current `balanced_packing` is a greedy approach. To improve balancedness, one might need to explore more sophisticated packing algorithms (e.g., algorithms that look ahead or use approximations for NP-hard problems), but that would significantly change the algorithm's core.\n\nThe prompt also mentioned: \"Consider simplifying the code to improve readability and maintainability\". The change above does offer a slight improvement in readability by making the intent of finding the minimum among available packs more explicit.\n\nLet's consider if there are any other simple optimizations.\nThe `replicate_experts` function has a loop:\n```python\n    for i in range(num_log, num_phy):\n        redundant_indices = (weight / logcnt).max(dim=-1).indices\n        phy2log[:, i] = redundant_indices\n        rank[:, i] = logcnt[arangen, redundant_indices]\n        logcnt[arangen, redundant_indices] += 1\n```\nThe `(weight / logcnt).max(dim=-1)` operation is repeated. If `num_phy - num_log` is large, this is a major cost.\nIf there are many logical experts, `max(dim=-1)` is O(num_log). The total is O((num_phy - num_log) * num_log).\n\nCould we optimize this?\nThe goal is to find the logical expert that, when given one more replica, results in the minimum *maximum* load across all physical experts.\nThe current greedy approach picks the logical expert `j` that maximizes `weight[i, j] / logcnt[i, j]`. This is a standard heuristic.\n\nPerhaps the issue is not the algorithm itself, but how it's implemented.\nThe fact that `balancedness_score` also regressed suggests that the overall strategy might have changed or become less effective.\n\nLet's stick with the `balanced_packing` optimization as it's a clear target for speed improvement and has a minor readability gain. The other parts are more complex to optimize without deeper analysis of the specific regressions.\n\nOne final thought: the prompt mentions \"Areas identified for improvement: - Consider simplifying the code to improve readability and maintainability\". The `rebalance_experts_hierarchical` function is quite dense. However, modifying it substantially without knowing the exact regression cause is risky. The `balanced_packing` change is more contained.\n\nThe change proposed for `balanced_packing` is a good balance between improving speed and maintaining the core logic.\n\n```python\n# The proposed change in balanced_packing:\n# Replacing:\n# pack = torch.argmin(\n#     torch.where(current_pack_items == groups_per_pack,\n#                 float('inf'),  # Set full packs to infinity\n#                 current_pack_weights)).item()\n#\n# With:\n# layer_weights = pack_weights_per_layer[i]\n# layer_items = pack_items_per_layer[i]\n# available_mask = layer_items < groups_per_pack\n# masked_weights = torch.where(available_mask, layer_weights, torch.finfo(layer_weights.dtype).max)\n# min_weight_val, pack_idx_tensor = torch.min(masked_weights, dim=-1)\n# pack = pack_idx_tensor.item()\n```\nThis uses `torch.min` on masked weights. It's a common optimization pattern.\nIt also makes the extraction of `layer_weights` and `layer_items` explicit, which might be slightly clearer.\n\n\nOne more check: the prompt states \"improve the algorithm to achieve better load balancing\". The proposed change to `balanced_packing` primarily targets speed. The balancedness aspect is related to the greedy choice. The change from `argmin(where(...))` to `min(where(...))` is unlikely to affect the balancedness score, as they are functionally equivalent in finding the minimum index. To improve balancedness, a different algorithm would be needed. Given the constraints, optimizing speed is the primary focus here, with a minor readability improvement.\n\nThe prompt also says \"Metrics showing regression: balancedness_score, speed_score, combined_score. Consider reverting or revising recent changes in these areas.\" This implies that the current code *is* the result of recent changes. My proposed change is a refinement of the existing logic, not a revert. It aims to make the current strategy faster and slightly clearer.\n\nThe primary goal is to improve the *algorithm's* efficiency. The `balanced_packing` function is a good place to start for efficiency gains.\n\nFinal decision: The proposed change to `balanced_packing` is the most suitable for this task.\n\n```python\n# The original code snippet to be replaced:\n#             current_pack_weights = pack_weights_per_layer[i]\n#             current_pack_items = pack_items_per_layer[i]\n\n#             # Find the pack with the minimum current weight among available ones.\n#             # Use torch.where to set weights of full packs to infinity without cloning,\n#             # which can be slightly more efficient and concise.\n#             pack = torch.argmin(\n#                 torch.where(current_pack_items == groups_per_pack,\n#                             float('inf'),  # Set full packs to infinity\n#                             current_pack_weights)).item()\n\n#             # Assert that a valid pack was found and it has space.\n#             assert current_pack_items[pack] < groups_per_pack\n\n#             # Assign the group to the chosen pack.\n#             # `group_id` is a 0-dim tensor, which can be directly used for indexing.\n#             pack_index[i, group_id] = pack\n#             rank_in_pack[i, group_id] = current_pack_items[pack]\n\n#             # Update pack weights and item counts for the chosen pack.\n#             # `weight[i, group_id]` is the weight of the current group.\n#             pack_weights_per_layer[i, pack] += weight[i, group_id]\n#             pack_items_per_layer[i, pack] += 1\n\n# The replacement code snippet:\n#             # Get the weights and item counts for all packs in the current layer directly.\n#             # This avoids creating intermediate Python variables for views.\n#             layer_weights = pack_weights_per_layer[i]\n#             layer_items = pack_items_per_layer[i]\n\n#             # Create a mask for packs that are not yet full.\n#             available_mask = layer_items < groups_per_pack\n\n#             # Apply a very large value (effectively infinity) to weights of full packs.\n#             # This allows us to use torch.min to find the least loaded available pack.\n#             # Using torch.finfo for max value is a robust way to handle different dtypes.\n#             masked_weights = torch.where(available_mask, layer_weights, torch.finfo(layer_weights.dtype).max)\n\n#             # Find the index of the minimum weight among available packs.\n#             # torch.min returns (values, indices). We need the index.\n#             min_weight_val, pack_idx_tensor = torch.min(masked_weights, dim=-1)\n            \n#             # Convert the index tensor to a scalar for assignment and further operations.\n#             pack = pack_idx_tensor.item()\n\n#             # Assert that a valid pack was found and it has space.\n#             assert layer_items[pack] < groups_per_pack\n\n#             # Assign the group to the chosen pack.\n#             # `group_id` is a 0-dim tensor, which can be directly used for indexing.\n#             pack_index[i, group_id] = pack\n#             rank_in_pack[i, group_id] = layer_items[pack]\n\n#             # Update pack weights and item counts for the chosen pack.\n#             # `weight[i, group_id]` is the weight of the current group.\n#             pack_weights_per_layer[i, pack] += weight[i, group_id]\n#             pack_items_per_layer[i, pack] += 1\n```\n\nThis change is targeted at `balanced_packing` for efficiency. It replaces `torch.argmin(torch.where(...))` with `torch.min` on a masked tensor, which may offer a performance improvement. It also slightly improves readability by making the intent clearer and avoiding intermediate Python variables for views.\n\n\n```python\n# The original code snippet to be replaced:\n#     for i in range(num_layers):\n#         # For each layer, process groups in sorted order of their weights.\n#         # `indices[i]` is a 1D tensor of group IDs for the current layer.\n#         for group_id in indices[i]:\n#             # Get current state for this layer's packs.\n#             current_pack_weights = pack_weights_per_layer[i]\n#             current_pack_items = pack_items_per_layer[i]\n\n#             # Find the pack with the minimum current weight among available ones.\n#             # Use torch.where to set weights of full packs to infinity without cloning,\n#             # which can be slightly more efficient and concise.\n#             pack = torch.argmin(\n#                 torch.where(current_pack_items == groups_per_pack,\n#                             float('inf'),  # Set full packs to infinity\n#                             current_pack_weights)).item()\n\n#             # Assert that a valid pack was found and it has space.\n#             assert current_pack_items[pack] < groups_per_pack\n\n#             # Assign the group to the chosen pack.\n#             # `group_id` is a 0-dim tensor, which can be directly used for indexing.\n#             pack_index[i, group_id] = pack\n#             rank_in_pack[i, group_id] = current_pack_items[pack]\n\n#             # Update pack weights and item counts for the chosen pack.\n#             # `weight[i, group_id]` is the weight of the current group.\n#             pack_weights_per_layer[i, pack] += weight[i, group_id]\n#             pack_items_per_layer[i, pack] += 1\n# =======\n#     for i in range(num_layers):\n#         # For each layer, process groups in sorted order of their weights.\n#         # `indices[i]` is a 1D tensor of group IDs for the current layer.\n#         for group_id in indices[i]:\n#             # Get the weights and item counts for all packs in the current layer directly.\n#             # This avoids creating intermediate Python variables for views.\n#             layer_weights = pack_weights_per_layer[i]\n#             layer_items = pack_items_per_layer[i]\n\n#             # Create a mask for packs that are not yet full.\n#             available_mask = layer_items < groups_per_pack\n\n#             # Apply a very large value (effectively infinity) to weights of full packs.\n#             # This allows us to use torch.min to find the least loaded available pack.\n#             # Using torch.finfo for max value is a robust way to handle different dtypes.\n#             masked_weights = torch.where(available_mask, layer_weights, torch.finfo(layer_weights.dtype).max)\n\n#             # Find the index of the minimum weight among available packs.\n#             # torch.min returns (values, indices).

The `balanced_packing` function is a core component that is called multiple times within the load balancing algorithm. The current implementation uses `torch.argmin(torch.where(...))` within a loop to find the least loaded pack that is not yet full. This operation can be computationally intensive, especially if the number of packs (`num_packs`) is large.\n\nThe proposed change aims to improve the efficiency of this selection process by:\n1.  **Using `torch.min` with a masked tensor**: Instead of creating a temporary tensor with `float('inf')` for full packs and then finding the minimum index with `torch.argmin`, this change first masks the weights of full packs to a very large value (`torch.finfo(layer_weights.dtype).max`) and then uses `torch.min(..., dim=-1)` to find the minimum value and its index. This approach is often well-optimized in PyTorch and can lead to performance gains.\n2.  **Improving Readability**: By explicitly creating `layer_weights` and `layer_items` and using a clear `available_mask`, the intent of finding the minimum among available packs becomes more explicit and easier to understand. This aligns with the goal of improving code readability and maintainability.\n3.  **Reducing Python Overhead**: Directly operating on `layer_weights` and `layer_items` (which are views) and then using `torch.min` can sometimes reduce the overhead associated with intermediate Python variable creation compared to repeated indexing with `current_pack_weights` and `current_pack_items`.\n\nWhile this change primarily targets the `speed_score` by optimizing a critical part of the `balanced_packing` function, it does so by refining the existing greedy strategy. It does not fundamentally alter the balancing logic itself, which might be necessary to address the `balancedness_score` regression. However, optimizing the execution speed of the current approach is a direct response to the performance metrics."]}}}
