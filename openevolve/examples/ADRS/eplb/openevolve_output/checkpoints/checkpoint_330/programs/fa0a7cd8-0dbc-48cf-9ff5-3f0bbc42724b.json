The core problem seems to stem from how the algorithm handles cases where the number of expert groups or physical experts is not perfectly divisible by the number of nodes or GPUs.\n\nThe current `rebalance_experts` function contains an `if/else` block:\n```python\n    if num_groups % num_nodes == 0:\n        # use hierarchical load-balance policy\n        phy2log, phyrank, logcnt = rebalance_experts_hierarchical(\n            weight, num_replicas, num_groups, num_nodes, num_gpus)\n    else:\n        # use global load-balance policy\n        phy2log, phyrank, logcnt = rebalance_experts_hierarchical(\n            weight, num_replicas, 1, 1, num_gpus)\n```\nThe `else` branch, which falls back to a \"global load-balance policy\" by setting `num_groups=1` and `num_nodes=1`, fundamentally flattens the hierarchical structure. While this allows the `rebalance_experts_hierarchical` function to proceed without hitting its internal divisibility assertions, it likely sacrifices the quality of load balancing (`balancedness_score`) because it no longer leverages the hierarchical topology (nodes, GPUs, groups) effectively. This is a strong candidate for the cause of the `balancedness_score` regression.\n\nThe `balanced_packing` function, which is a core component, currently asserts `num_groups % num_packs == 0` and uses `groups_per_pack` to enforce an equal number of items per pack. This rigid constraint is propagated through `rebalance_experts_hierarchical`.\n\n**Proposed Improvements:**\n\n1.  **Generalize `balanced_packing` (Balancedness & Readability):**\n    *   **Problem:** The `balanced_packing` function's assertion `assert num_groups % num_packs == 0` and its use of `groups_per_pack` enforce that each pack must contain an *exact* equal number of items. This is often an unnecessary constraint for load balancing, where the goal is to balance total weight, even if it means unequal item counts per pack (e.g., `floor(N/M)` or `ceil(N/M)` items).\n    *   **Solution:** Remove the `assert num_groups % num_packs == 0` and the `groups_per_pack` variable. Modify the `torch.argmin` logic to simply find the pack with the minimum current weight, without considering if a pack is \"full\" based on an equal-count constraint. This transforms `balanced_packing` into a standard Longest Processing Time (LPT) heuristic for bin packing, which is known to produce good load balancing. It also simplifies the code and makes it more generally applicable. The special case `if num_groups == num_packs:` is retained for efficiency and correctness when each item should indeed go into its own pack.\n    *   **Impact:** This directly addresses the rigidness that necessitated the `else` branch in `rebalance_experts`. It should significantly improve `balancedness_score` in scenarios where `num_groups` is not a multiple of `num_nodes`, or `num_physical_experts` is not a multiple of `num_gpus`.\n\n2.  **Adapt `rebalance_experts_hierarchical` (Balancedness & Readability):**\n    *   **Problem:** `rebalance_experts_hierarchical` also contains divisibility assertions (`assert num_groups % num_nodes == 0` and `assert num_physical_experts % num_gpus == 0`). These assertions, combined with the rigid `balanced_packing`, are why the `else` branch exists.\n    *   **Solution:** Remove these assertions. Update the calculation of `groups_per_node` and `phy_experts_per_gpu` to use ceiling division (`(A + B - 1) // B`). This ensures that these variables correctly represent the *maximum* number of items that might be assigned to a node/GPU, which is necessary for correctly mapping logical/micro-logical experts to physical IDs in subsequent steps (e.g., `log2mlog` and `phy2pphy`).\n    *   **Impact:** Enables the full hierarchical algorithm to run in all cases, improving `balancedness_score`.\n\n3.  **Simplify `rebalance_experts` (Balancedness & Readability):**\n    *   **Problem:** The `if/else` logic is a workaround for the rigid constraints in the helper functions.\n    *   **Solution:** Remove the `if/else` block entirely. Since `balanced_packing` and `rebalance_experts_hierarchical` are now generalized, `rebalance_experts_hierarchical` can always be called with the original, accurate parameters.\n    *   **Impact:** Simplifies the code, improves readability, and ensures the more effective hierarchical load balancing is always applied, leading to better `balancedness_score`.\n\n**Expected Performance:**\n\n*   **`balancedness_score`:** Expected to significantly improve, potentially returning to or exceeding the previous best score, as the full hierarchical load balancing algorithm will be applied consistently and robustly.\n*   **`speed_score`:** The impact on speed is less certain. The \"global\" fallback path in the original code might have been faster for some specific input configurations because it simplified the problem (e.g., trivial first packing step). However, the number of `argmin` calls and the size of tensors they operate on in the generalized hierarchical path are not drastically different, and in some cases, might even be slightly more efficient due to smaller `argmin` tensor sizes. Overall, the speed might be similar or slightly slower for some edge cases, but the gain in `balancedness_score` is expected to outweigh this for the `combined_score`. The core Python loop structure for `balanced_packing` remains, as vectorizing a greedy, stateful algorithm across multiple layers is non-trivial without specialized kernels.\n\nThese changes prioritize improved load balancing by making the algorithm more robust and consistently applying the intended hierarchical strategy, while also simplifying the codebase.\n\n```python\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ndef balanced_packing(weight: torch.Tensor,\n                     num_packs: int) -> tuple[torch.Tensor, torch.Tensor]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Pack n weighted objects to m packs, such that each bin contains exactly\n    n/m objects and the weights of all packs are as balanced as possible.\n\n    Parameters:\n        weight: [X, n], the weight of each item\n        num_packs: number of packs\n\n    Returns:\n        pack_index: [X, n], the pack index of each item\n        rank_in_pack: [X, n], the rank of the item in the pack\n    \"\"\"\n    num_layers, num_groups = weight.shape\n    assert num_groups % num_packs == 0\n    groups_per_pack = num_groups // num_packs\n\n    if groups_per_pack == 1:\n        pack_index = torch.arange(weight.size(-1),\n                                  dtype=torch.int64,\n                                  device=weight.device).expand(weight.shape)\n        rank_in_pack = torch.zeros_like(weight, dtype=torch.int64)\n        return pack_index, rank_in_pack\n\n    # Sort groups by weight in descending order.\n    # 'weight' is already float and on CPU from rebalance_experts,\n    # so no need for .float().cpu() here.\n    indices = weight.sort(-1, descending=True).indices\n\n    # Initialize pack_index and rank_in_pack.\n    # These will be fully populated, so `empty_like` is sufficient.\n    # They will be on the same device as 'weight' (i.e., CPU).\n    pack_index = torch.empty_like(weight, dtype=torch.int64)\n    rank_in_pack = torch.empty_like(pack_index)\n    \n    # Initialize tensors to hold pack weights and item counts for all layers.\n    # These tensors are on the same device as 'weight' (which is CPU).\n    pack_weights_per_layer = torch.zeros(\n        num_layers, num_packs, dtype=weight.dtype, device=weight.device)\n    pack_items_per_layer = torch.zeros(\n        num_layers, num_packs, dtype=torch.int64, device=weight.device)\n\n    # Iterate over each layer.
