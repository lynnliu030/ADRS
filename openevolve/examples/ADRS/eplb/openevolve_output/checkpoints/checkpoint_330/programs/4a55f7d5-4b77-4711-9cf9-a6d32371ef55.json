Each SEARCH section must exactly match code in the current program.\nBe thoughtful about your changes and explain your reasoning thoroughly.\n\nIMPORTANT: Do not rewrite the entire program - focus on targeted improvements.\n", "responses": ["The current performance metrics show a significant regression in `speed_score` compared to previous top-performing programs. The `balancedness_score` remains consistent. My primary focus will be to address the speed regression while also improving code readability, as suggested in the \"Areas identified for improvement\".\n\nThe core rearrangement algorithm is adapted from DeepSeek EPLB, which typically uses well-established greedy heuristics for load balancing (e.g., LPT rule for packing, highest average load for replication). These heuristics are generally good for `balancedness_score` given the NP-hard nature of perfect load balancing. Therefore, significant improvements in `balancedness_score` without sacrificing efficiency would likely require a more complex algorithm, which is outside the scope of targeted improvements.\n\nThe most probable cause for the `speed_score` regression is the explicit transfer of the `weight` tensor to CPU using `.cpu()`. If the `weight` tensor originates from a vLLM server that operates on GPUs, this transfer to CPU for computation and then back (if results are needed on GPU) can introduce a substantial overhead. All PyTorch operations used in `balanced_packing`, `replicate_experts`, and `rebalance_experts_hierarchical` are fully supported on GPU. By removing the `.cpu()` call, the algorithm will execute on the device where the `weight` tensor resides, potentially leveraging GPU acceleration if available.\n\nAdditionally, to improve readability and maintainability, the `inverse` helper function, which is a general utility for inverting permutations, can be moved out of `rebalance_experts_hierarchical` to a top-level helper function within the `EVOLVE-BLOCK`.\n\nHere are the proposed changes:\n\n1.  **Remove `.cpu()` call:** This will allow the load balancing computations to run on the GPU if the input `weight` tensor is already on the GPU, directly addressing the `speed_score` regression. The `float()` conversion is kept as the algorithm relies on floating-point arithmetic.\n2.  **Refactor `inverse` function:** Move the `inverse` helper function out of `rebalance_experts_hierarchical` and rename it to `_inverse_permutation` (to indicate it's an internal helper). This improves code organization and readability by separating a general utility from the specific logic of `rebalance_experts_hierarchical`.\n\nThese changes are low-risk as they do not alter the core greedy logic of the balancing algorithm, thus preserving the `balancedness_score`, while significantly improving `speed_score` by avoiding unnecessary device transfers and leveraging GPU computation.\n\n---\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    weight = weight.float().cpu()\n    if num_groups % num_nodes == 0:\n=======\n    weight = weight.float()\n    if num_groups % num_nodes == 0:\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ndef rebalance_experts_hierarchical(\n    weight: torch.Tensor,\n    num_physical_experts: int,\n    num_groups: int,\n    num_nodes: int,\n    num_gpus: int,\n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Parameters:\n        weight: [num_moe_layers, num_logical_experts]\n        num_physical_experts: number of physical experts after replication\n        num_groups: number of expert groups\n        num_nodes: number of server nodes, where the intra-node network\n        (e.g, NVLink) is faster\n        num_gpus: number of GPUs, must be a multiple of `num_nodes`\n\n    Returns:\n        physical_to_logical_map: [num_moe_layers, num_physical_experts]\n        logical_to_physical_map: [num_moe_layers, num_logical_experts, X]\n        logical_count: [num_moe_layers, num_logical_experts]\n    \"\"\"\n    num_layers, num_logical_experts = weight.shape\n    assert num_logical_experts % num_groups == 0\n    group_size = num_logical_experts // num_groups\n    assert num_groups % num_nodes == 0\n    groups_per_node = num_groups // num_nodes\n    assert num_gpus % num_nodes == 0\n    assert num_physical_experts % num_gpus == 0\n    phy_experts_per_gpu = num_physical_experts // num_gpus\n\n    def inverse(perm: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:\n        inv = torch.empty_like(perm)\n        inv.scatter_(\n            1,\n            perm,\n            torch.arange(perm.size(1), dtype=torch.int64,\n                         device=perm.device).expand(perm.shape),\n        )\n        return inv\n\n    #
