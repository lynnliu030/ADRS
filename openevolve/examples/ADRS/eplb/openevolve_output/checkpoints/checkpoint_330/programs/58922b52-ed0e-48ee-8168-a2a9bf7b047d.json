Each SEARCH section must exactly match code in the current program.\nBe thoughtful about your changes and explain your reasoning thoroughly.\n\nIMPORTANT: Do not rewrite the entire program - focus on targeted improvements.\n", "responses": ["The current program's performance metrics indicate a regression in `speed_score` and `combined_score`. The `balancedness_score` is stable. The identified areas for improvement include simplifying code for readability/maintainability and improving efficiency.\n\nThe core rearrangement algorithm relies on `balanced_packing` and `replicate_experts`. Both functions involve repeatedly finding the minimum/maximum element from a set of candidates (packs or logical experts). The current implementation uses `torch.argmin` or `torch.max` on potentially large tensors within Python loops, which can be inefficient.\n\n**Key Improvement Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Optimize `balanced_packing` and `replicate_experts` with `heapq`**: Replace the repeated linear scans (`torch.argmin`, `torch.max`) with a min-heap (or max-heap simulation using `heapq`). A heap allows finding the minimum/maximum element in O(log N) time, significantly improving the overall complexity from O(N\\*M) to O(N\\*log M) for the inner loops, where N is the number of iterations and M is the size of the candidates. This is a standard optimization for greedy scheduling/partitioning problems.\n2.  **Ensure CPU operations for Python-bound logic**: The `heapq` module operates on Python scalars. If the input `weight` tensor is on a GPU, repeatedly calling `.item()` to extract scalar values for heap operations would incur significant device-to-host transfer overhead. To avoid this, the `weight` tensor should be explicitly moved to CPU at the beginning of `rebalance_experts` and results moved back to the original device before returning. The current code's comments suggest `weight` is already on CPU, but the actual implementation (`weight = weight.float()`) does not guarantee this if the input was on GPU.\n\n**Detailed Changes:**\n\n1.  **Add `import heapq`**: The `heapq` module is required for heap operations.\n2.  **Modify `rebalance_experts`**:\n    *   Store the original device of the `weight` tensor.\n    *   Explicitly move `weight` to CPU (`weight.float().cpu()`) to optimize Python-level operations within `balanced_packing` and `replicate_experts`.\n    *   Move the final output tensors (`phy2log`, `log2phy`, `logcnt`) back to the `original_device` before returning.\n3.  **Modify `balanced_packing`**:\n    *   For each layer, initialize a min-heap with `(current_pack_weight, pack_id)` for all packs, starting with zero weights.\n    *   Inside the loop that assigns groups to packs, use `heapq.heappop` to get the least loaded pack.\n    *   Update the pack's weight and item count.\n    *   If the pack is not yet full, use `heapq.heappush` to re-insert it into the heap with its new weight.\n    *   This replaces the less efficient `torch.where` and `torch.argmin` calls.\n4.  **Modify `replicate_experts`**:\n    *   For each layer, initialize a max-heap (by storing negative average loads) with `(-average_load, logical_expert_id)` for all logical experts.\n    *   Inside the loop that assigns redundant experts, use `heapq.heappop` to get the logical expert with the highest average load per replica.\n    *   Update the `logcnt` for the chosen expert.\n    *   Calculate the new average load and use `heapq.heappush` to re-insert the expert into the heap.\n\nThese changes will significantly improve the `speed_score` by optimizing the inner loops of the expert rearrangement algorithm, while maintaining or potentially slightly improving `balancedness_score` as the underlying greedy strategy remains the same but is executed more efficiently.\n\n```diff\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nimport torch\n=======\nimport torch\nimport heapq\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    num_layers, num_logical_experts = weight.shape\n    # Cast weight to float for calculations if not already, and keep on original device.\n    # Moving to CPU adds overhead if data is already on GPU and might slow down ops.\n    weight = weight.float()\n    \n    if num_groups % num_nodes == 0:\n=======\n    num_layers, num_logical_experts = weight.shape\n    \n    # Store original device to move results back later.\n    original_device = weight.device\n    \n    # Cast weight to float for calculations and move to CPU.\n    # Python's heapq and scalar operations (.item()) are efficient on CPU tensors.\n    weight = weight.float().cpu()\n    \n    if num_groups % num_nodes == 0:\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    # Initialize tensors to hold pack weights and item counts for all layers.\n    # These tensors are on the same device as 'weight' (which is CPU).\n    pack_weights_per_layer = torch.zeros(\n        num_layers, num_packs, dtype=weight.dtype, device=weight.device)\n    pack_items_per_layer = torch.zeros(\n        num_layers, num_packs, dtype=torch.int64, device=weight.device)\n\n    # Iterate over each layer.
