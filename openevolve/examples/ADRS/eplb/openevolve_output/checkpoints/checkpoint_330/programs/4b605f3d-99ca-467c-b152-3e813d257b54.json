This is a critical bug that prevents the algorithm from running correctly. Fixing this bug is the primary and most impactful improvement.\n\nAdditionally, I've identified a minor efficiency improvement in `replicate_experts` by removing unnecessary `.item()` calls. When performing arithmetic operations between PyTorch tensors (even 0-dimensional ones), PyTorch can often handle the operations efficiently in C++ without needing to convert to Python scalars via `.item()`. This can provide a small speedup, especially if these operations are performed frequently.\n\n**Detailed plan for improvements:**\n\n1.  **Bug Fix:** In `balanced_packing`, replace the undefined `current_group_weight` with the correct tensor access `weight[i, group_id]`. This is essential for the program to function.\n2.  **Efficiency Improvement:** In `replicate_experts`, remove `.item()` calls when calculating `new_avg_load`. The tensors `current_expert_weight` (float) and `current_logcnt` (int64) can be directly divided, and PyTorch will handle the type promotion and calculation efficiently.\n\nThese changes address both the critical error and provide a minor performance optimization, aligning with the goal of improving balancedness and speed.\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n            # Calculate new load for the pack.\n            new_load = current_load + current_group_weight # Use pre-fetched weight\n\n            # If the pack is not yet full, push it back to the heap with its new load.\n            if current_pack_items[pack] < groups_per_pack:\n                heapq.heappush(pack_heap, (new_load, pack))\n=======\n            # Calculate new load for the pack using the actual group's weight.\n            new_load = current_load + weight[i, group_id]\n\n            # If the pack is not yet full, push it back to the heap with its new load.\n            # Otherwise, this pack is full and will not be considered further for this layer.\n            if current_pack_items[pack] < groups_per_pack:\n                heapq.heappush(pack_heap, (new_load, pack))\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n            current_expert_weight = weights_for_layer[log_expert_id]\n            \n            # Fetch the count for the specific expert, one .item() call\n            current_logcnt = logcnt[i_layer, log_expert_id].item() \n\n            # Calculate new average load\n            new_avg_load = current_expert_weight.item() / current_logcnt # One .item() call here\n            heapq.heappush(current_heap, (-new_avg_load, log_expert_id))\n=======\n            current_expert_weight = weights_for_layer[log_expert_id]\n            \n            # Fetch the count for the specific expert.\n            # current_logcnt is a 0-dim tensor, no need for .item() for arithmetic.\n            current_logcnt = logcnt[i_layer, log_expert_id]\n\n            # Calculate new average load.
