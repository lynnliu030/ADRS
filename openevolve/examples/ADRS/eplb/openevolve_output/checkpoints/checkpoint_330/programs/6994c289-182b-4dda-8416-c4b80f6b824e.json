However, the performance metrics show a regression compared to previous attempts. This suggests that either the recent changes introduced inefficiencies, or the algorithm itself has limitations that are becoming more apparent.\n\nLet's analyze the code and identify potential areas for improvement, focusing on both balancedness and speed.\n\n**Areas for Improvement:**\n\n1.  **`balanced_packing` Efficiency:**\n    *   The `balanced_packing` function uses a greedy approach. While generally effective, the inner loop iterates through all `num_groups` and for each group, it finds the minimum weight pack. This could be optimized.\n    *   The creation of `inf_mask_tensor` inside `balanced_packing` is done in every call. If `balanced_packing` is called multiple times with the same `num_packs`, this tensor can be pre-created outside the function.\n    *   The current implementation of finding the minimum weight pack involves `torch.where` and `torch.argmin`. This can sometimes be slow due to conditional logic on tensors.\n\n2.  **`replicate_experts` Efficiency:**\n    *   The loop in `replicate_experts` iterates from `num_log` to `num_phy`. Inside the loop, it computes `redundant_indices` using `max(dim=-1).indices`, which might be a bottleneck.\n\n3.  **Code Readability and Simplification:**\n    *   The `rebalance_experts_hierarchical` function has many nested calculations and tensor manipulations. Simplifying some of these could improve readability and potentially expose optimization opportunities.\n    *   The logic for mapping between different expert indices (`log2mlog`, `mlog2log`, `pphy2mlog`, `pphy2log`) is complex.\n\n4.  **Hierarchical vs. Global Policy:**\n    *   The current code uses `rebalance_experts_hierarchical` even when `num_groups` is not divisible by `num_nodes`, by setting `num_groups=1`, `num_nodes=1`. This might not be the most optimal way to handle the global policy. A dedicated global balancing strategy might be more efficient.\n\nLet's focus on the most impactful changes first, aiming for both speed and balancedness.\n\n**Proposed Changes:**\n\n### Improvement 1: Optimize `balanced_packing` for Speed\n\nThe core of `balanced_packing` is assigning items to packs greedily. We can potentially speed this up by using a more direct assignment mechanism if the number of packs is significantly smaller than the number of items. However, given the current structure, let's focus on optimizing the inner loop's pack selection.\n\nInstead of repeatedly using `torch.where` and `torch.argmin` to find the best pack, we can maintain the pack loads and directly assign items. A min-heap could be used to efficiently find the pack with the minimum load, but PyTorch's tensor operations might be faster if we can vectorize.\n\nLet's reconsider the `balanced_packing` logic. The goal is to assign `num_groups` items (sorted by weight) into `num_packs` such that each pack gets `groups_per_pack` items and the total weight per pack is balanced. The current approach iterates through sorted items and assigns them to the least loaded pack.\n\nA potential optimization is to recognize that if `groups_per_pack` is small, we can directly assign items in a round-robin fashion after sorting. However, the current code correctly assigns items to the least loaded pack iteratively.\n\nLet's focus on making the existing greedy assignment faster. The `inf_mask_tensor` creation can be moved outside if `balanced_packing` is called multiple times with the same `num_packs`. However, in `rebalance_experts_hierarchical`, `num_nodes` and `num_gpus // num_nodes` can vary, making pre-creation tricky.\n\nA more direct optimization for speed in `balanced_packing`:\nThe current loop structure iterates `num_layers` times, and then `num_groups` times. Inside the inner loop, it finds the minimum weight pack. This is O(num_layers * num_groups * num_packs) if `torch.argmin` is O(num_packs).\n\nConsider if we can pre-sort the packs and assign items.\nIf `groups_per_pack` is small, we can assign items in a round-robin manner to the sorted items.\n\nLet's try to optimize the pack selection within the inner loop.\nThe current code:\n```python\n            # Find available packs (those not yet full).\n            available_mask = (current_pack_items < groups_per_pack)\n\n            # Find the pack with the minimum current weight among available ones.\n            # Set weights of unavailable packs to infinity to exclude them from argmin.\n            candidate_weights = torch.where(available_mask, current_pack_weights, inf_mask_tensor)\n            \n            # Use torch.argmin to find the index of the pack with the minimum weight.\n            # This returns a 0-dim tensor, which can be used for indexing.\n            pack = torch.argmin(candidate_weights)\n```\nThis part is the bottleneck. We are essentially doing a k-way merge of sorted lists (the packs' current loads).\n\nA potential optimization is to use `torch.sort` on the `candidate_weights` and then pick the first available pack. However, `torch.argmin` is generally efficient.\n\nLet's look at `replicate_experts`. The loop iterates `num_redundant` times. Inside, `max(dim=-1).indices` is computed.\n\nConsider the `rebalance_experts_hierarchical` function.\nThe lines:\n```python\n    log2mlog = (((group_pack_index * groups_per_node + group_rank_in_pack) *\n                 group_size).unsqueeze(-1) +\n                torch.arange(group_size,\n                             dtype=torch.int64,\n                             device=group_pack_index.device)).flatten(-2)\n    mlog2log = inverse(log2mlog)\n```\nThese are mapping indices. `inverse` itself is a scatter operation, which is generally efficient.\n\nThe most promising area for speed improvement might be in `balanced_packing`.\nLet's consider the structure of `balanced_packing`. It sorts items and then greedily assigns them. If `groups_per_pack` is small, a simpler assignment might be faster.\nFor example, if `groups_per_pack = 1`, the code handles it separately.\n\nLet's focus on the greedy assignment part. The `torch.where` and `torch.argmin` combination is what we want to optimize.\nInstead of creating `inf_mask_tensor` and using `torch.where`, we can directly operate on the `current_pack_weights` and `current_pack_items`.\n\nConsider `torch.segment_reduce` or similar operations if we can structure the problem. However, that might overcomplicate it.\n\nLet's try a minor optimization in `balanced_packing` by pre-allocating `inf_mask_tensor` outside the loop if possible, or by reducing the number of operations.\n\nThe current `balanced_packing` is O(L * G * P) where L is num_layers, G is num_groups, P is num_packs.\nThe `replicate_experts` is O(L * log * R) where R is num_redundant.\n\nThe regression suggests that the current implementation, while perhaps theoretically sound, has practical performance issues in PyTorch.\n\nLet's propose a change to `balanced_packing` that might be more efficient by avoiding `torch.where` inside the tight loop.\n\n**Proposed Change 1: Optimize `balanced_packing` pack selection**\n\nThe goal is to assign `k` items to `n` bins, `groups_per_pack` items per bin, minimizing the max bin sum. The current code does this greedily.\n\nConsider this: if we have `num_packs` and `groups_per_pack`, we need to assign `num_groups` items.\nThe current loop iterates through `num_groups` sorted items. For each item, it finds the least loaded pack that is not full.\n\nLet's try to simplify the pack selection logic.\nIf we sort the *packs* by their current load and assign the current item to the least loaded pack, this is what's happening.\n\nAlternative approach for `balanced_packing`:\nInstead of iterating through items and finding the best pack, can we iterate through packs and assign items to them?\nThis would involve partitioning the sorted `current_layer_indices` into `num_packs` chunks of size `groups_per_pack`. The problem is that the items within each chunk need to be assigned to ensure balanced weights.\n\nThe current greedy approach is likely correct for balancedness. The speed issue might come from the repeated `torch.where` and `torch.argmin`.\n\nLet's try to use `torch.scatter_reduce` or similar if possible.\nThe problem is that we need to find the minimum *available* pack.\n\nConsider the state: `current_pack_weights`, `current_pack_items`.\nFor each item `k`:\n1. Find packs `p` where `current_pack_items[p] < groups_per_pack`.\n2. Among these, find `p_min` that minimizes `current_pack_weights[p]`.\n3. Assign item `k` to `p_min`.\n4. Update `current_pack_weights[p_min]` and `current_pack_items[p_min]`.\n\nThis is exactly what the code does. The efficiency concern is that `torch.where` and `torch.argmin` are called `num_groups` times per layer.\n\nLet's try to reorganize `balanced_packing` to make the pack selection more direct.\nIf `groups_per_pack` is small, we can pre-allocate slots in packs.\n\nConsider the case where `groups_per_pack` is large.\nThe current approach iterates through items.\nWhat if we sort the packs by current load and assign items?\nThis is not straightforward because we need to maintain `groups_per_pack` items per pack.\n\nLet's focus on the `inf_mask_tensor`. Creating it repeatedly could be a minor overhead.\nHowever, the primary issue is likely the `torch.where` and `torch.argmin` inside the loop.\n\nConsider a different approach to find the minimum available pack.\nInstead of masking and finding argmin, we could:\n1.

Get the weights of these available packs: `available_weights = current_pack_weights[available_indices]`\n3. Find the minimum among these: `min_weight_idx_in_available = torch.argmin(available_weights)`\n4. Get the actual pack index: `pack = available_indices[min_weight_idx_in_available]`\n\nThis might be slightly more efficient as it avoids creating the large `inf_mask_tensor` and then masking. It directly works with available packs.\n\nLet's implement this change in `balanced_packing`.\n\n```python\n# Current code snippet in balanced_packing:\n            # Find available packs (those not yet full).\n            available_mask = (current_pack_items < groups_per_pack)\n\n            # Find the pack with the minimum current weight among available ones.\n            # Set weights of unavailable packs to infinity to exclude them from argmin.\n            candidate_weights = torch.where(available_mask, current_pack_weights, inf_mask_tensor)\n            \n            # Use torch.argmin to find the index of the pack with the minimum weight.\n            # This returns a 0-dim tensor, which can be used for indexing.\n            pack = torch.argmin(candidate_weights)\n```\n\nThis change aims to improve the speed of `balanced_packing` by reducing the overhead of `torch.where` and `inf_mask_tensor` creation within the inner loop. It directly selects the minimum from available packs.\n\n```python\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n            # Find available packs (those not yet full).\n            available_mask = (current_pack_items < groups_per_pack)\n\n            # Find the pack with the minimum current weight among available ones.\n            # Set weights of unavailable packs to infinity to exclude them from argmin.\n            candidate_weights = torch.where(available_mask, current_pack_weights, inf_mask_tensor)\n            \n            # Use torch.argmin to find the index of the pack with the minimum weight.\n            # This returns a 0-dim tensor, which can be used for indexing.\n            pack = torch.argmin(candidate_weights)\n\n            # Assert that a valid pack was found and it has space.\n            # Removed assert for performance, assuming input conditions are met.\n            # In a production system, consider adding this as a debug-only assert.\n\n            # Assign the group to the chosen pack.\n            pack_index[i, group_id] = pack\n            rank_in_pack[i, group_id] = current_pack_items[pack]\n\n            # Update pack weights and item counts for the chosen pack.\n            group_weight = weight[i, group_id]\n            pack_weights_per_layer[i, pack] += group_weight\n            pack_items_per_layer[i, pack] += 1\n=======\n            # Find the indices of packs that are not yet full.\n            available_indices = torch.where(current_pack_items < groups_per_pack)[0]\n\n            # If there are available packs, find the one with the minimum current weight.\n            if available_indices.numel() > 0:\n                available_weights = current_pack_weights[available_indices]\n                min_weight_idx_in_available = torch.argmin(available_weights)\n                pack = available_indices[min_weight_idx_in_available]\n\n                # Assign the group to the chosen pack.\n                pack_index[i, group_id] = pack\n                rank_in_pack[i, group_id] = current_pack_items[pack]\n\n                # Update pack weights and item counts for the chosen pack.\n                group_weight = weight[i, group_id]\n                pack_weights_per_layer[i, pack] += group_weight\n                pack_items_per_layer[i, pack] += 1\n            # else: This case should ideally not happen if the logic is correct\n            # and num_groups is divisible by groups_per_pack, but handling it\n            # defensively could prevent crashes.

This is done via `(weight / logcnt).max(dim=-1).indices`. This operation, especially `max(dim=-1).indices`, can be costly within a loop.\n\nLet's consider if we can optimize this. The goal is to distribute `num_redundant` extra replicas among the `num_log` logical experts to minimize the maximum load. This is a form of load balancing.\n\nThe current approach is to iteratively pick the \"best\" logical expert to replicate.\nThe \"best\" expert is defined as the one that, if replicated, would result in the smallest increase in the maximum load *for that expert*. This is approximated by picking the expert with the highest `weight / logcnt`.\n\nA potentially faster way to achieve a similar outcome might be to sort all `weight / logcnt` values and pick the top `num_redundant` experts. However, this doesn't account for the fact that replicating an expert changes its `logcnt` and thus its `weight / logcnt` for future iterations. The current iterative approach is more accurate for this greedy strategy.\n\nThe efficiency issue might stem from the repeated calculation of `weight / logcnt`.\n\nLet's try to optimize the calculation of `redundant_indices`.\nInstead of recalculating `weight / logcnt` every time, we could maintain a list of `(load_per_replica, expert_index)` and use a min-heap to extract the one with the smallest load per replica. However, we are picking the *highest* `weight / logcnt` to replicate. So, a max-heap would be appropriate.\n\nThe current implementation is already using `max(dim=-1).indices`. Let's try to make this more efficient.\nThe issue is that `logcnt` changes.\n\nConsider the total number of items to distribute: `num_redundant`.\nWe want to assign these to `num_log` experts.\nThe current code iteratively finds the expert that has the highest load per replica (i.e., `weight[i, j] / logcnt[i, j]`).\n\nLet's analyze the `replicate_experts` loop:\n```python\n    for i in range(num_log, num_phy):\n        redundant_indices = (weight / logcnt).max(dim=-1).indices\n        phy2log[:, i] = redundant_indices\n        rank[:, i] = logcnt[arangen, redundant_indices]\n        logcnt[arangen, redundant_indices] += 1\n```\nThe division `weight / logcnt` is performed for all `num_log` experts in each iteration.\nThe `max(dim=-1).indices` finds the index of the maximum value across the `num_log` experts.\n\nThis could be optimized by maintaining the `weight / logcnt` values and updating them. A max-heap of `(weight/logcnt, expert_index)` would be suitable.\n\nLet's try to implement this using a max-heap. However, Python's `heapq` is not designed for GPU tensors. If the operations are on GPU, we need a GPU-compatible heap or a different approach. Given that the weights are typically on GPU, we should aim for GPU-accelerated operations.\n\nIf we stick to PyTorch tensor operations:\nThe bottleneck is `(weight / logcnt).max(dim=-1).indices`.\nLet's assume `weight` and `logcnt` are on GPU.\n\nA simpler optimization might be to pre-calculate `weight / logcnt` once per iteration and then find the max. The current code does this.\n\nConsider if the number of redundant experts is large.\nThe problem is equivalent to distributing `num_redundant` tokens to `num_log` bins, where each bin `j` has a capacity `C_j` and a current load `L_j`. We want to minimize the maximum `L_j`.\nThis is a variation of the multiway number partitioning problem.\n\nThe current greedy approach is likely a good heuristic. The speed issue might be in the implementation of `max(dim=-1).indices`.\n\nLet's stick to optimizing the existing structure.\nThe `replicate_experts` function is called within `rebalance_experts_hierarchical`.\nThe `weight` tensor passed to `replicate_experts` is `tokens_per_mlog`, which has shape `[num_layers * num_nodes, num_logical_experts // num_nodes]`. Let `N = num_layers * num_nodes` and `M = num_logical_experts // num_nodes`.\nThe loop runs `(num_physical_experts // num_nodes) - M` times.\nInside the loop, `(weight / logcnt).max(dim=-1).indices` is computed.\nThis is `N` times repeated computations of `weight / logcnt` and `max(dim=-1).indices`.\n\nLet's consider pre-sorting `weight / logcnt` and using it.\nIf we sort `weight / logcnt` for each row (each `N` dimension), we can pick the top ones.\nHowever, `logcnt` changes dynamically.\n\nA potential optimization for `replicate_experts`:\nInstead of recalculating `weight / logcnt` from scratch, can we maintain a sorted list of these values?\n\nConsider the `logcnt` tensor. It's `[N, M]`.\n`weight` is `[N, M]`.\nThe loop is `for i in range(num_log, num_phy):` where `num_log` is `M` and `num_phy` is `num_physical_experts // num_nodes`.\n\nLet's analyze the memory access pattern.\n`weight / logcnt`: element-wise division.\n`.max(dim=-1)`: reduction along the last dimension.\n`.indices`: gets the indices of the maximum.\n\nThis operation is likely already efficient if implemented in PyTorch's C++ backend.\nThe regression could be due to how `replicate_experts` is called or how its output is used.\n\nLet's focus on a more straightforward code simplification that might also improve performance.\nThe `rebalance_experts_hierarchical` function has a complex flow.\n\nConsider the calculation of `log2mlog`:\n```python\n    log2mlog = (((group_pack_index * groups_per_node + group_rank_in_pack) *\n                 group_size).unsqueeze(-1) +\n                torch.arange(group_size,\n                             dtype=torch.int64,\n                             device=group_pack_index.device)).flatten(-2)\n```\nThis maps logical experts within a group to their final physical expert indices after packing groups to nodes.\nThe `group_pack_index` is `[num_layers, num_groups]` and `group_rank_in_pack` is `[num_layers, num_groups]`.\n`tokens_per_group` is `[num_layers, num_groups]`.\n\nThe `inverse` function is used twice.\n`mlog2log = inverse(log2mlog)`\n`pphy2mlog = phy2mlog.gather(-1, pphy2phy)`\n\nThe `logcnt` is also reshaped and gathered.\n\nMaybe the issue is in the `else` block of `rebalance_experts`:\n```python\n    else:\n        # use global load-balance policy\n        phy2log, phyrank, logcnt = rebalance_experts_hierarchical(\n            weight, num_replicas, 1, 1, num_gpus)\n```\nThis calls the hierarchical function with `num_groups=1`, `num_nodes=1`. This might not be the intended global policy. A true global policy would balance across all `num_logical_experts` directly.\n\n**Proposed Change 2: Implement a dedicated Global Load Balancing Policy**\n\nIf `num_groups % num_nodes != 0`, the current code falls back to a hierarchical approach with `num_groups=1` and `num_nodes=1`. This effectively treats all experts as one large group and balances across GPUs. This might not be optimal. A dedicated global balancing function would be better.\n\nFor a global policy, we would simply replicate experts to achieve `num_replicas` total physical experts, aiming to balance the load across all physical experts. This is essentially what `replicate_experts` does, but applied globally.\n\nLet's redefine `rebalance_experts_global` and call it when `num_groups % num_nodes != 0`.\n\n```python\ndef rebalance_experts_global(\n    weight: torch.Tensor,\n    num_physical_experts: int,\n) -> tuple[torch.Tensor, torch.Tensor, torch.Tensor]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Replicates logical experts to `num_physical_experts` to balance load globally.\n\n    Parameters:\n        weight: [num_moe_layers, num_logical_experts]\n        num_physical_experts: total number of physical experts after replication\n\n    Returns:\n        physical_to_logical_map: [num_moe_layers, num_physical_experts]\n        rank: [num_moe_layers, num_physical_experts]\n        logical_count: [num_moe_layers, num_logical_experts]\n    \"\"\"\n    num_layers, num_logical_experts = weight.shape\n    num_redundant = num_physical_experts -

The `rebalance_experts_global` function is a more direct implementation of global replication balancing.\n\n### Proposed Change 3: Simplify `balanced_packing` tensor creation\n\nIn `balanced_packing`, the `inf_mask_tensor` is created inside the loop over layers. If `num_packs` is constant across layers, this tensor can be created once outside the layer loop. However, `num_packs` here is `num_nodes` or `num_gpus // num_nodes` in `rebalance_experts_hierarchical`. These values can change.\nThe `inf_mask_tensor` creation is on the device of `weight`. If `weight` is on GPU, this is a GPU operation.\n\nThe primary bottleneck is the `torch.where` and `torch.argmin` within the inner loop. The previous change (Proposed Change 1) addresses this more directly. This change is minor but could contribute to speed.\n\nLet's reconsider the `inf_mask_tensor`. It's created inside the layer loop, but before the item loop.\n```python\n    # Initialize tensors to hold pack weights and item counts for all layers.\n    # These should be on the same device as 'weight'.\n    pack_weights_per_layer = torch.zeros(\n        num_layers, num_packs, dtype=weight.dtype, device=weight.device)\n    pack_items_per_layer = torch.zeros(\n        num_layers, num_packs, dtype=torch.int64, device=weight.device)\n\n    # Pre-compute an 'inf' tensor on the correct device to avoid repeated creation.\n    # This tensor is used to mask unavailable packs.\n    inf_mask_tensor = torch.full((num_packs,), float('inf'), dtype=weight.dtype, device=weight.device)\n```\nThis tensor is created once per layer loop. This is fine. The issue was if it was created inside the `k` loop.\n\nThe first proposed change is likely the most impactful for speed within `balanced_packing`.\n\nFinal check on the changes:\n1.  **`balanced_packing` optimization:** Replace `torch.where` + `torch.argmin` with direct indexing of available packs. This should improve speed by avoiding intermediate tensor creation and conditional logic.\n2.  **Global policy implementation:** Introduce `rebalance_experts_global` and use it when `num_groups % num_nodes != 0`. This provides a more appropriate global balancing strategy and might improve both balancedness and speed by avoiding an inefficient hierarchical fallback.\n\nThese two changes address the identified areas: improving `balanced_packing` speed and providing a better global policy. They also aim for better balancedness by using a more direct global balancing strategy.\n\nThe code simplification aspect is addressed by introducing a dedicated `rebalance_experts_global` function, making the `rebalance_experts` function cleaner. The `balanced_packing` optimization, while primarily for speed, also makes the logic slightly more direct by avoiding the \"masking then argmin\" pattern.\n\nLet's ensure the diff format is strictly followed.\n\nOne final thought on `replicate_experts`:\nThe original `replicate_experts` is a helper. It might be called by `rebalance_experts_hierarchical`.\nThe change to `rebalance_experts` to use `rebalance_experts_global` for the else case is the primary focus.\n\nThe `replicate_experts` function itself might be a candidate for optimization if it's a bottleneck.\nThe current implementation of `replicate_experts`:\n```python\ndef replicate_experts(\n        weight: torch.Tensor,\n        num_phy: int) -> tuple[torch.Tensor, torch.Tensor, torch.Tensor]:\n    # ...\n    for i in range(num_log, num_phy):\n        redundant_indices = (weight / logcnt).max(dim=-1).indices\n        phy2log[:, i] = redundant_indices\n        rank[:, i] = logcnt[arangen, redundant_indices]\n        logcnt[arangen, redundant_indices] += 1\n    return phy2log, rank, logcnt\n```\nThis function is called with `tokens_per_mlog`, which has `num_layers * num_nodes` rows.\nThe bottleneck is `(weight / logcnt).max(dim=-1).indices`.\n\nIf we can optimize this calculation, it would be beneficial.\nConsider a strategy where we calculate `load_per_replica = weight / logcnt` for all layers at once. Then, we sort the flattened `load_per_replica` and use the top `num_redundant` indices. However, this would not update `logcnt` dynamically.\n\nThe current iterative approach is correct for this greedy strategy. If there's a performance issue, it's likely in the PyTorch implementation of `max(dim=-1).indices` or the division itself.\n\nLet's stick with the proposed changes as they directly address the observed regressions and areas for improvement.\n\nSummary of proposed changes:\n1.  **`balanced_packing` optimization:** Improve speed by directly selecting from available packs.\n2.  **Global policy implementation:** Introduce `rebalance_experts_global` and use it for the global load balancing case to provide a more appropriate strategy.\n\nThese changes aim to improve both balancedness (via better global policy) and speed (via `balanced_packing` optimization).\n\n```python\n# Example of how the diff should look for the first change:\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n            # Find available packs (those not yet full).\n            available_mask = (current_pack_items < groups_per_pack)\n\n            # Find the pack with the minimum current weight among available ones.\n            # Set weights of unavailable packs to infinity to exclude them from argmin.\n            candidate_weights = torch.where(available_mask, current_pack_weights, inf_mask_tensor)\n            \n            # Use torch.argmin to find the index of the pack with the minimum weight.\n            # This returns a 0-dim tensor, which can be used for indexing.\n            pack = torch.argmin(candidate_weights)\n\n            # Assert that a valid pack was found and it has space.\n            # Removed assert for performance, assuming input conditions are met.\n            # In a production system, consider adding this as a debug-only assert.\n\n            # Assign the group to the chosen pack.\n            pack_index[i, group_id] = pack\n            rank_in_pack[i, group_id] = current_pack_items[pack]\n\n            # Update pack weights and item counts for the chosen pack.\n            group_weight = weight[i, group_id]\n            pack_weights_per_layer[i, pack] += group_weight\n            pack_items_per_layer[i, pack] += 1\n=======\n            # Find the indices of packs that are not yet full.\n            available_indices = torch.where(current_pack_items < groups_per_pack)[0]\n\n            # If there are available packs, find the one with the minimum current weight.\n            if available_indices.numel() > 0:\n                available_weights = current_pack_weights[available_indices]\n                min_weight_idx_in_available = torch.argmin(available_weights)\n                pack = available_indices[min_weight_idx_in_available]\n\n                # Assign the group to the chosen pack.\n                pack_index[i, group_id] = pack\n                rank_in_pack[i, group_id] = current_pack_items[pack]\n\n                # Update pack weights and item counts for the chosen pack.\n                group_weight = weight[i, group_id]\n                pack_weights_per_layer[i, pack] += group_weight\n                pack_items_per_layer[i, pack] += 1\n            # else: This case should ideally not happen if the logic is correct\n            # and num_groups is divisible by groups_per_pack, but handling it\n            # defensively could prevent crashes.
