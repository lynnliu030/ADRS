# Adaptive Weight Compression 

## Note: Work in Progress

This code is currently **work in progress** and will be shared once the research work is officially released. The implementation of `ptq.py` is based on a heavily modified version of [SpinQuant](https://github.com/facebookresearch/SpinQuant). 

The complete implementation including the proprietary adaptive quantization algorithm and optimized kernels will be made available upon release of the research work.
