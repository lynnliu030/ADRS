# Barbarians at the Gate: How AI is Upending Systems Research

This repository contains code implementations from the paper **"Barbarians at the Gate: How AI is Upending Systems Research"** ([arXiv:2510.06189](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06189)). 

Some examples are still work in progress (WIP) and code may be private â€” we're actively updating and releasing them. Stay tuned!

## Setup

Make sure you have [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) installed.

```bash
uv sync
export OPENAI_API_KEY="..."
export GEMINI_API_KEY="..."
```

## Examples

This repository showcases AI-driven research examples across multiple frameworks and domains:
